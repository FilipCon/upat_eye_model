abstract = {Listing's law governs the three-dimensional orientation of the eye and its axes of rotation. It states that, when the head is fixed, there is an eye position called primary position, such that the eye assumes only those orientations that can be reached from primary position by a single rotation about an axis in a plane called Listing's plane. Listing's law can also be expressed in terms of any initial eye position, not just primary position (Listing's half-angle rule). The binocular extension of Listing's law is equivalent to Listing's law when the vergence angle is zero, and adjusts the eyes' torsion when they converge. Listing's law holds during fixation, saccades, smooth pursuit, and vergence, but not during sleep and vestibulo-ocular reflex, suggesting that it is actively implemented by a neural mechanism. Orbital constraints, such as “pulleys,” may also play a role. Adherence to Listing's law and its extension may serve the purpose of optimizing motor efficiency, or simplifying neural processing for binocular vision, or both. The study of Listing's law not only allows us to understand the organization of neural and mechanical factors in the control of three-dimensional eye movements, it also has important clinical implications for strabismus and the optimal management of this disorder.},

abstract = {Dynamic simulation of human eye movements, with realistic physical models of extraocular muscles (EOMs), may greatly advance our understanding of the complexities of the oculomotor system and aid in treatment of visuomotor disorders. In this paper we describe the first three dimensional (3D) biomechanical model which can simulate the dynamics of ocular motility at interactive rates. We represent EOMs using “strands”, which are physical primitives that can model an EOM's complex nonlinear anatomical and physiological properties. Contact between the EOMs, the globe, and orbital structures can be explicitly modeled. Several studies were performed to assess the validity and utility of the model. EOM deformation during smooth pursuit was simulated and compared with published experimental data; the model reproduces qualitative features of the observed nonuniformity. The model is able to reproduce realistic saccadic trajectories when the lateral rectus muscle was driven by published measurements of abducens neuron discharge. Finally, acute superior oblique palsy, a pathological condition, was simulated to further evaluate the system behavior; the predicted deviation patterns agree qualitatively with experimental observations. This example also demonstrates potential clinical applications of such a model.},

@article{Kono2002a,
abstract = {PURPOSE: The orbital layer of each rectus extraocular muscle (EOM) inserts on connective tissue, and the global layer inserts on the eyeball. The active-pulley hypothesis (APH) proposes that a condensation of this connective tissue constitutes a pulley serving as the functional origin of the rectus EOM, and that this pulley makes coordinated, gaze-related translations along the EOM axis to implement a linear ocular motor plant. This study was designed to measure gaze-related shifts in EOM pulley locations. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in eight normal volunteers in 2-mm thickness coronal planes perpendicular to the orbital axis for nine cardinal gaze directions. Intravenous gadodiamide contrast was administered to define EOM tendons anterior to the globe equator. Paths of EOMs, defined by their area centroids, were transformed into an oculocentric coordinate system. Sharp inflections in EOM paths in secondary and tertiary gaze positions defined pulley locations which were then correlated with gaze direction and compared with theoretical predictions. RESULTS: Rectus pulley positions were consistent with a central primary position. In tertiary gaze positions, each of the four rectus pulleys translated posteriorly with EOM contraction and anteriorly with EOM relaxation by a significant (P {\textless} 0.02) amount predicted by the APH, but more than 100 times greater than the translation predicted by a passive pulley model. CONCLUSIONS: The APH prediction of coordinated anteroposterior shifting of EOM pulleys with gaze is quantitatively supported by changes in EOM path inflections among tertiary-gaze positions. Human rectus pulleys move to shift the ocular rotational axis to attain commutative behavior of the ocular motor plant.},

abstract = {Reducing the knee adduction moment (KAM) is a promising treatment for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA). Although several gait modifications to lower the KAM have been identified, the potential to combine modifications and individual dose-responses remain unknown. This study hypothesized that: (i) there is a general scheme consisting of modifications in trunk sway, step width, walking speed, and foot progression angle that reduces the KAM; (ii) gait modifications can be combined; (iii) dose-responses differ among individuals. Walking trials with simultaneous modifications in step width, walking speed, progression angle, and trunk sway were analyzed for 10 healthy subjects. Wider step width, slower speed, toeing-in, and increased trunk sway resulted in reduced first KAM peak, whereas wider step width, faster speed, and increased trunk sway reduced the KAM angular impulse. Individual regressions accurately modeled the amplitude of the KAM variables relative to the amplitude of the gait modification variables, while the dose-responses varied strongly among participants. In conclusion, increasing trunk sway, increasing step width, and toeing-in are three gait modifications that could be combined to reduce KAM variables related to knee OA. Results also indicated that some gait modifications reducing the KAM induced changes in the knee flexion moment possibly indicative of an increase in knee loading. Taken together with the different dose-responses among subjects, this study suggested that gait retraining programs should consider this general scheme of modifications with individualization of the modification amplitudes.

Spatially separate regions of the GPi were labeled after virus injections into each cortical area. The GPi projects to multiple cortical motor areas, and this pallidal output is organized into discrete channels.

@article{Sharifi2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by ASME.In this paper, the optimal performance of a planar humanlike musculoskeletal arm is investigated during reaching movements employing an optimal control policy. The initial and final states (position and velocity) are the only known data of the response trajectory. Two biomechanical objective functions are taken into account to be minimized as the central nervous system (CNS) strategy: (1) a quadratic function of muscle stresses (or forces), (2) total time of movement plus a quadratic function of muscle stresses. A two-degress of freedom (DOF) nonlinear musculoskeletal arm model (for planar movements) with six muscle actuators and four state variables is used in order to evaluate the proposed optimal policy, while the constraints of the arm motion and muscle forces are considered mathematically. The nonlinear differential equations of this optimal control problem with the first objective function are solved using the method of variation of extremals (VE). For the second objective function, a modified version of the VE method is employed. Accordingly, the optimal total time of the motion is predicted via the second objective function in addition to the optimal trajectory and forces that are also predicted using the first objective function. The influence of the motion time duration on the optimal trajectory is shown and discussed. Finally, the obtained optimal trajectories are compared to the experimental trajectories of the human arm movements.},

@article{Seth2010,
abstract = {Biomechanical systems share many properties with mechanically engineered systems, and researchers have successfully employed mechanical engineering simulation software to investigate the mechanical behavior of diverse biological mechanisms, ranging from biomolecules to human joints. Unlike their man-made counterparts, however, biomechanisms rarely exhibit the simple, uncoupled, pure-axial motion that is engineered into mechanical joints such as sliders, pins, and ball-and-socket joints. Current mechanical modeling software based on internal-coordinate multibody dynamics can formulate engineered joints directly in minimal coordinates, but requires additional coordinates restricted by constraints to model more complex motions. This approach can be inefficient, inaccurate, and difficult for biomechanists to customize. Since complex motion is the rule rather than the exception in biomechanisms, the benefits of minimal coordinate modeling are not fully realized in biomedical research. Here we introduce a practical implementation for empirically-defined internal-coordinate joints, which we call "mobilizers." A mobilizer encapsulates the observations, measurement frame, and modeling requirements into a hinge specification of the permissible-motion manifold for a minimal set of internal coordinates. Mobilizers support nonlinear mappings that are mathematically equivalent to constraint manifolds but have the advantages of fewer coordinates, no constraints, and exact representation of the biomechanical motion-space-the benefits long enjoyed for internal-coordinate models of mechanical joints. Hinge matrices within the mobilizer are easily specified by user-supplied functions, and provide a direct means of mapping permissible motion derived from empirical data. We present computational results showing substantial performance and accuracy gains for mobilizers versus equivalent joints implemented with constraints. Examples of mobilizers for joints from human biomechanics and molecular dynamics are given. All methods and examples were implemented in Simbody™-an open source multibody-dynamics solver available at https://Simtk.org.},

abstract = {Rhythmic and discrete movements are frequently considered separately in motor control, probably because different techniques are commonly used to study and model them. Yet the increasing interest in finding a comprehensive model for movement generation requires bridging the different perspectives arising from the study of those two types of movements. In this article, we consider discrete and rhythmic movements within the framework of motor primitives, i.e., of modular generation of movements. In this way we hope to gain an insight into the functional relationships between discrete and rhythmic movements and thus into a suitable representation for both of them. Within this framework we can define four possible categories of modeling for discrete and rhythmic movements depending on the required command signals and on the spinal processes involved in the generation of the movements. These categories are first discussed in terms of biological concepts such as force fields and central pattern generators and then illustrated by several mathematical models based on dynamical system theory. A discussion on the plausibility of theses models concludes the work.},

abstract = {Cells of the musculoskeletal system are known to respond to mechanical loading and chondrocytes within the cartilage are not an exception. However, understanding how joint level loads relate to cell level deformations, e.g. in the cartilage, is not a straightforward task. In this study, a multi-scale analysis pipeline was implemented to post-process the results of a macro-scale finite element (FE) tibiofemoral joint model to provide joint mechanics based displacement boundary conditions to micro-scale cellular FE models of the cartilage, for the purpose of characterizing chondrocyte deformations in relation to tibiofemoral joint loading. It was possible to identify the load distribution within the knee among its tissue structures and ultimately within the cartilage among its extracellular matrix, pericellular environment and resident chondrocytes. Various cellular deformation metrics (aspect ratio change, volumetric strain, cellular effective strain and maximum shear strain) were calculated. To illustrate further utility of this multi-scale modeling pipeline, two micro-scale cartilage constructs were considered: an idealized single cell at the centroid of a 100×100×100 $\mu$m block commonly used in past research studies, and an anatomically based (11 cell model of the same volume) representation of the middle zone of tibiofemoral cartilage. In both cases, chondrocytes experienced amplified deformations compared to those at the macro-scale, predicted by simulating one body weight compressive loading on the tibiofemoral joint. In the 11 cell case, all cells experienced less deformation than the single cell case, and also exhibited a larger variance in deformation compared to other cells residing in the same block. The coupling method proved to be highly scalable due to micro-scale model independence that allowed for exploitation of distributed memory computing architecture. The method's generalized nature also allows for substitution of any macro-scale and/or micro-scale model providing application for other multi-scale continuum mechanics problems.},

abstract = {Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is most common in the medial tibial compartment. We present a novel method to study the effect of gait modifications and lateral wedge insoles (LWIs) on the stresses in the medial tibial cartilage by combining musculoskeletal (MS) modelling with finite element (FE) analysis. Subject's gait was recorded in a gait laboratory, walking normally, with 5° and 10° LWIs, toes inward (‘Toe in'), and toes outward (‘Toe out wide'). A full lower extremity MRI and a detailed knee MRI were taken. Bones and most soft tissues were segmented from images, and the generic bone architecture of the MS model was morphed into the segmented bones. The output forces from the MS model were then used as an input in the FE model of the subject's knee. During stance, LWIs failed to reduce medial peak pressures apart from Insole 10° during the second peak. Toe in reduced peak pressures by −11{\%} during the first peak but increased them by 12{\%} during the second.

abstract = {Whereas muscle spindles play a prominent role in current theories of human motor control, Golgi tendon organs (GTO) and their associated tendons are often neglected. This is surprising since there is ample evidence that both tendons and GTOs contribute importantly to neuromusculoskeletal dynamics. Using detailed musculoskeletal models, we provide evidence that simple feedback using muscle spindles alone results in very poor control of joint position and movement since muscle spindles cannot sense changes in tendon length that occur with changes in muscle force. We propose that a combination of spindle and GTO afferents can provide an estimate of muscle-tendon complex length, which can be effectively used for low-level feedback during both postural and movement tasks. The feasibility of the proposed scheme was tested using detailed musculoskeletal models of the human arm. Responses to transient and static perturbations were simulated using a 1-degree-of-freedom (DOF) model of the arm and showed that the combined feedback enabled the system to respond faster, reach steady state faster, and achieve smaller static position errors. Finally, we incorporated the proposed scheme in an optimally controlled 2-DOF model of the arm for fast point-to-point shoulder and elbow movements. Simulations showed that the proposed feedback could be easily incorporated in the optimal control framework without complicating the computation of the optimal control solution, yet greatly enhancing the system's response to perturbations. The theoretical analyses in this study might furthermore provide insight about the strong physiological couplings found between muscle spindle and GTO afferents in the human nervous system.},

abstract = {The pathway of voluntary joint torque production includes motor neuron recruitment and rate-coding, sarcolemmal depolarization and calcium release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, force generation by motor proteins within skeletal muscle, and force transmission by tendon across the joint. The direct source of energetic support for this process is ATP hydrolysis. It is possible to examine portions of this physiologic pathway using various in vivo and in vitro techniques, but an integrated view of the multiple processes that ultimately impact joint torque remains elusive. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive computational model of the combined neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems that includes novel components related to intracellular bioenergetics function. Components representing excitatory drive, muscle activation, force generation, metabolic perturbations, and torque production during voluntary human ankle dorsiflexion were constructed, using a combination of experimentally-derived data and literature values. Simulation results were validated by comparison with torque and metabolic data obtained in vivo. The model successfully predicted peak and submaximal voluntary and electrically-elicited torque output, and accurately simulated the metabolic perturbations associated with voluntary contractions. This novel, comprehensive model could be used to better understand impact of global effectors such as age and disease on various components of the neuromuscular system, and ultimately, voluntary torque output.},

In Part I the approach was developed from a consideration of the fundamental mechanics of manipulation. Part II presented techniques for implementing a desired manipulator impedance. In Part III a technique for choosing the impedance appropriate to a given application using optimization theory is presented. Based on a simplified analysis it is shown that if the task objective is to tradeoff interface forces and motion errors, the manipulator impedance should be proportional to the environmental admillance. An application of impedance control to unconstrained motion is presented. The superposition properties of nonlinear impedances are used to develop a real-time feedback control algorithm which permits a manipulator to avoid unpredictably moving objects without explicit path planning.},

The corticostriatal system has been mapped using cytological techniques which give little information on the physiological importance of projections from individual cortical areas. The objective of this study was to characterize the three-dimensional topography of the corticostriatal system in the rat and to determine the physiological significance of these projections using electrophysiological techniques. Eight functionally distinct areas of the cerebral cortex (prefrontal, primary motor, rostral and caudal primary somatosensory, hindlimb, auditory, occipital and primary visual) were stimulated while recording the multiple unit activity in seven dorsal and seven ventral areas of the caudoputamen. Each stimulation site produced a distinctive pattern of activation within the caudoputamen. There was also a large site-dependent variation in electrophysiological activation produced by each stimulation. The motor and somatosensory areas produced the most powerful overall activation. In addition, a number of trends were obvious. There was a rostrocaudal topographical relationship between the site of stimulation and the area of the caudoputamen activated. Furthermore, more caudally and medially placed stimulation sites produced greater dorsal activation of the caudoputamen relative to ventral.},

abstract = {The singularity problem is an inherent problem in controlling robot manipulators with articulated configuration. The authors propose to determine the joint motion for the requested motion of the endeffector by evaluating the feasibility of the joint motion. The determined joint motion is called an inverse kinematic solution with singularity robustness, because it denotes feasible solution even at or in the neighborhood of singular points. The singularity robust inverse (SR-inverse) is introduced as an alternative to the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian matrix. The SR-inverse of the Jacobian matrix provides them with an approximating motion close to the desired Cartesian trajectory of the endeffector, even when the inverse kinematic solution by the inverse or the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian matrix is not feasible at or in the neighborhood of singular points. The properties of the SR-inverse are clarified by comparing it with the inverse and the pseudoinverse. The computational complexity of the SR-inverse is considered to discuss its implementability. Several simulation results are also shown to illustrate the singularity problem and the effectiveness of the inverse kinematic solution with singularity robustness},

abstract = {A finite element model of the eye and the orbit was used to examine the hypothesis that the orbital fat provides an important mechanism of eye stability during head trauma. The model includes the globe, the orbital fat, the extra-ocular muscles, and the optic nerve. MRI images of an adult human orbit were used to generate an idealized geometry of the orbital space. The globe was approximated as a sphere 12mm in radius. The optic nerve and the sclera were represented as thin shells, whereas the vitreous and the orbital fat were represented as nearly incompressible solids of low stiffness. The orbital bone was modelled as a rigid shell. Frontal head impact resulting from a fall onto a hard floor was simulated by prescribing to the orbital bone a triangular acceleration pulse of 200 g (1962 m/s2) peak for a duration of 4.5 ms. The results show that the fat provides the crucial passive mechanism of eye restraint. The mechanism is a consequence of the fact that the fat is incompressible and that its motion is restricted by the rigidity of the orbital walls. Thus, the acceleration loads of short duration cannot generate significant distortion of the fat. In contrast, the passive muscles provide little support to the globe. When the connection between the orbital fat and the eye is absent the eye is held mainly by the optic nerve.We discuss the possible role that this loss of contact may have in some cases of the evulsion of the eye and the optic nerve. {\&}copy; 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the general structure for the explicit equations of motion for general mechanical systems subjected to holonomic and non-holonomic equality constraints. The constraints considered here need not satisfy D'Alembert's principle, and our derivation is not based on the principle of virtual work. Therefore, the equations obtained here have general applicability. They show that in the presence of such constraints, the constraint force acting on the system can always be viewed as made up of the sum of two components. The explicit form for each of the two components is provided. The first of these components is the constraint force that would have existed, were all the constraints ideal; the second is caused by the non-ideal nature of the constraints, and though it needs specification by the mechanician and depends on the particular situation at hand, this component nonetheless has a specific form. The paper also provides a generalized form of D'Alembert's principle which is then used to obtain the explicit equations of motion for constrained mechanical systems where the constraints may be non-ideal. We show an example where the new general, explicit equations of motion obtained in this paper are used to directly write the equations of motion for describing a non-holonomically constrained system with non-ideal constraints. Lastly, we provide a geometrical description of constrained motion and thereby exhibit the simplicity with which Nature seems to operate. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Tools have been used for millions of years to augment the capabilities of the human body, allowing us to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. Powered exoskeletons and other assistive devices are sophisticated modern tools that have restored bipedal locomotion in individuals with paraplegia and have endowed unimpaired individuals with superhuman strength. Despite these successes, designing assistive devices that reduce energy consumption during running remains a substantial challenge, in part because these devices disrupt the dynamics of a complex, finely tuned biological system. Furthermore, designers have hitherto relied primarily on experiments, which cannot report muscle-level energy consumption and are fraught with practical challenges. In this study, we use OpenSim to generate muscle-driven simulations of 10 human subjects running at 2 and 5 m/s. We then add ideal, massless assistive devices to our simulations and examine the predicted changes in muscle recruitment patterns and metabolic power consumption. Our simulations suggest that an assistive device should not necessarily apply the net joint moment generated by muscles during unassisted running, and an assistive device can reduce the activity of muscles that do not cross the assisted joint. Our results corroborate and suggest biomechanical explanations for similar effects observed by experimentalists, and can be used to form hypotheses for future experimental studies. The models, simulations, and software used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and can provide insight into assistive device design that complements experimental approaches.},

abstract = {Tomorrow's humanoids will operate in human environments, where efficient manipulation and locomotion skills, and safe contact interactions are critical design factors. We report here our recent efforts into these issues, materialized into a whole-body control framework. This framework integrates task-oriented dynamic control and control prioritization allowing to control multiple task primitives while complying with physical and movement-related constraints. Prioritization establishes a hierarchy between control spaces, assigning top priority to constraint-handling tasks, while projecting operational tasks in the null space of the constraints, and controlling the posture within the residual redundancy. This hierarchy is directly integrated at the kinematic level, allowing the program to monitor behavior feasibility at runtime. In addition, prioritization allows us to characterize the dynamic behavior of the individual control primitives subject to the constraints, and to synthesize operational space controllers at multiple levels. To complete this framework, we have developed free-floating models of the humanoid and incorporate the associated dynamics and the effects of the resulting support contacts into the control hierarchy. As part of a long term collaboration with Honda, we are currently implementing this framework into the humanoid robot Asimo},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. This paper presents a framework for the creation of virtual human behavioural profile which will account for physiological parameters of the body during motion activities. Initially, the subject's movements are captured along with the corresponding joint trajectories using a single Kinect sensor. To improve the fidelity of the motion trajectories a series of filters were implemented so as to diminish the effect of noise. Next, a musculoskeletal model of the human lower extremity with twenty degrees of freedom and 86 muscles is introduced and registered to the captured motion data through the inverse kinematics method. For the computational analysis and the estimation of joint torques during movements inverse and forward dynamics are utilized respectively. Finally, static optimization and computed muscle control are employed to estimate the muscle forces and muscle excitations necessary to perform the captured movements. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach, leading to numerous applications in the field of physics-based computer animation and virtual physiological human modeling.},

abstract = {Muscle-driven simulations of human and animal motion are widely used to complement physical experiments for studying movement dynamics. Musculotendon models are an essential component of muscle-driven simulations, yet neither the computational speed nor the biological accuracy of the simulated forces has been adequately evaluated. Here we compare the speed and accuracy of three musculotendon models: two with an elastic tendon (an equilibrium model and a damped equilibrium model) and one with a rigid tendon. Our simulation benchmarks demonstrate that the equilibrium and damped equilibrium models produce similar force profiles but have different computational speeds. At low activation, the damped equilibrium model is 29 times faster than the equilibrium model when using an explicit integrator and 3 times faster when using an implicit integrator; at high activation, the two models have similar simulation speeds. In the special case of simulating a muscle with a short tendon, the rigid-tendon model produces forces that match those generated by the elastic-tendon models, but simulates 2-54 times faster when an explicit integrator is used and 6-31 times faster when an implicit integrator is used. The equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models reproduce forces generated by maximally-activated biological muscle with mean absolute errors less than 8.9{\%}, 8.9{\%}, and 20.9{\%} of the maximum isometric muscle force, respectively. When compared to forces generated by submaximally-activated biological muscle, the forces produced by the equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models have mean absolute errors less than 16.2{\%}, 16.4{\%}, and 18.5{\%}, respectively. To encourage further development of musculotendon models, we provide implementations of each of these models in OpenSim version 3.1 and benchmark data online, enabling others to reproduce our results and test their models of musculotendon dynamics.},

abstract = {Background Previous research indicates that subjects with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction exhibit abnormal knee joint movement patterns during functional activities like walking. While the sagittal plane mechanics have been studied extensively, less is known about the secondary planes, specifically with regard to more demanding tasks. This study explored the influence of task complexity on functional joint mechanics in the context of graft-specific surgeries. Methods In 25 participants (10 hamstring tendon graft, 6 patellar tendon graft, 9 matched controls), three-dimensional joint torques were calculated using a standard inverse dynamics approach during level walking and stair descent. The stair descent task was separated into two functionally different sub-tasks - step-to-floor and step-to-step. The differences in external knee moment profiles were compared between groups; paired differences between the reconstructed and non-reconstructed knees were also assessed. Findings The reconstructed knees, irrespective of graft type, typically exhibited significantly lower peak knee flexion moments compared to control knees during stair descent, with the differences more pronounced in the step-to-step task. Frontal plane adduction torque deficits were graft specific and limited to the hamstring tendon knees during the step-to-step task. Internal rotation torque deficits were also primarily limited to the hamstring tendon graft group during stair descent. Collectively, these results suggest that task complexity was a primary driver of differences in joint mechanics between anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed individuals and controls, and such differences were more pronounced in individuals with hamstring tendon grafts. Interpretation The mechanical environment experienced in the cartilage during repetitive, cyclical tasks such as walking and other activities of daily living has been argued to contribute to the development of degenerative changes to the joint and ultimately osteoarthritis. Given the task-specific and graft-specific differences in joint mechanics detected in this study, care should be taken during the rehabilitation process to mitigate these changes.},

Our approach, inspired by the minimum variance principle of Harris and Wolpert (1998 Nature 394 780-4) and the optimal feedback control principles put forth by Todorov and Jordan (2002 Nature Neurosci. 5 1226-35) for explaining human movements, differs in two crucial respects: (i) the endpoint variance is minimized in joint space rather than Cartesian hand space, and (ii) we ignore the dynamics and instead consider only the second-order differential kinematics. The feedback control law generating the motions can be straightforwardly obtained by backward integration of a set of ordinary differential equations; these equations are obtained exactly, without any linear-quadratic approximations. The only parameters to be determined a priori are the variance scale factors, and for both the two-DOF planar arm and the seven-DOF spatial arm, a table of values is constructed based on the given initial and final arm configurations; these values are determined via an optimal fitting procedure, and consistent with existing findings about neuromuscular motor noise levels of human arm muscles. Experiments conducted with a two-link planar arm and a seven-DOF spatial arm verify that the trajectories generated by our feedback control law closely resemble human arm motions, in the sense of producing nearly straight-line hand trajectories, having bell-shaped velocity profiles, and satisfying Fitts Law.},

abstract = {This paper presents a unified approach for inverse and direct dynamics of constrained multibody systems that can serve as a basis for analysis, simulation, and control. The main advantage of the dynamics formulation is that it does not require the constraint equations to be linearly independent. Thus, a simulation may proceed even in the presence of redundant constraints or singular configurations, and a controller does not need to change its structure whenever the mechanical system changes its topology or number of degrees of freedom. A motion-control scheme is proposed based on a projected inverse-dynamics scheme which proves to be stable and minimizes the weighted Euclidean norm of the actuation force. The projection-based control scheme is further developed for constrained systems, e.g., parallel manipulators, which have some joints with no actuators (passive joints). This is complemented by the development of constraint force control. A condition on the inertia matrix resulting in a decoupled mechanical system is analytically derived that simplifies the implementation of the force control. Finally, numerical and experimental results obtained from dynamic simulation and control of constrained mechanical systems, based on the proposed inverse and direct dynamics formulations, are documented.},

abstract = {This paper presents a knee-joint model to provide a better understanding on the interaction between natural joints and artificial mechanisms for design and control of rehabilitation exoskeletons. The anatomically based knee model relaxes several commonly made assumptions that approximate a human knee as engineering pin-joint in exoskeleton design. Based on published MRI data, we formulate the kinematics of a knee-joint and compare three mathematical approximations; one model bases on two sequential circles rolling a flat plane; and the other two are mathematically differentiable ellipses-based models with and without sliding at the contact. The ellipses-based model taking sliding contact into accounts shows that the rolling-sliding ratio of a knee-joint is not a constant but has an average value consistent with published measurements. This knee-joint kinematics leads to a physically more accurate contact-point trajectory than methods based on multiple circles or lines, and provides a basis to derive a knee-joint kinetic model upon which the effects of a planar exoskeleton mechanism on the internal joint forces and torque during flexion can be numerically investigated. Two different knee-joint kinetic models (pin-joint approximation and anatomically based model) are compared against a condition with no exoskeleton. The leg and exoskeleton form a closed kinematic chain that has a significant effect on the joint forces in the knee. Human knee is more tolerant than pin-joint in negotiating around a singularity but its internal forces increase with the exoskeleton mass-to-length ratio. An oversimplifying pin-joint approximation cannot capture the finite change in the knee forces due to the singularity effect. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{Objective: To investigate physical function in patients with severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees during and after a general physical training program. Design: Randomized control trial, blinded observer, follow-up at 3 months and 1 year. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Patients: Consecutive sample of 25 patients (3 men, 22 women) with OA of the knees according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Two patients (8{\%}) failed to complete the study. There were no withdrawals for adverse effects. Intervention: Twelve patients received training in groups of 6, twice a week for 3 months. Training focused on general fitness, balance, coordination, stretching, and lower extremity muscle strength, and included a daily home exercise program. Main Outcome Measures: Muscle strength across the knee (extension and flexion), Algofunctional Index (AFI), pain (0 to 10 point scale), walking speed, clinical findings. Results: Patients participated in 96 of 96 assessments (100{\%}) and in 218 of 280 training sessions (77.9{\%}). From baseline to 3 months, isokinetic quadriceps strength (30°/sec) improved 20{\%} (confidence interval [CI] 2$\alpha$ = .05, 8{\%} to 50{\%}) in the least affected leg; isometric strength improved 21{\%}. By 1 year, AFI had decreased 3.8 points (CI2$\alpha$, = .05, 1.0 to 7.0), pain had decreased 2.0 points (CI(2{\}}, = .05, 0.0 to 4.0), and walking speed had increased 13{\%} (CI(2$\alpha$) = .05, 4{\%} to 23{\%}). There was an increase in the frequency of palpable joint effusions (p {\textless} .01) on the most affected side. Frequency of crepitus decreased on the least affected side (p {\textless} .01). Conclusions: General physical training appears to be beneficial to patients with OA of the knee. As shown by the high compliance and low dropout frequency, such a program is feasible even in patients with severe OA of the knee.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of the human arm are regulated to maintain stability across many tasks. The static mechanics of the arm can be characterized by estimates of endpoint stiffness, considered especially relevant for the maintenance of posture. At a fixed posture, endpoint stiffness can be regulated by changes in muscle activation, but which activation-dependent muscle properties contribute to this global measure of limb mechanics remains unclear. We evaluated the role of muscle properties in the regulation of endpoint stiffness by incorporating scalable models of muscle stiffness into a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model of the human arm. Two classes of muscle models were tested: one characterizing short-range stiffness and two estimating stiffness from the slope of the force-length curve. All models were compared with previously collected experimental data describing how endpoint stiffness varies with changes in voluntary force. Importantly, muscle properties were not fit to the experimental data but scaled only by the geometry of individual muscles in the model. We found that force-dependent variations in endpoint stiffness were accurately described by the short-range stiffness of active arm muscles. Over the wide range of evaluated arm postures and voluntary forces, the musculoskeletal model incorporating short-range stiffness accounted for 98 ± 2, 91 ± 4, and 82 ± 12{\%} of the variance in stiffness orientation, shape, and area, respectively, across all simulated subjects. In contrast, estimates based on muscle force-length curves were less accurate in all measures, especially stiffness area. These results suggest that muscle short-range stiffness is a major contributor to endpoint stiffness of the human arm. Furthermore, the developed model provides an important tool for assessing how the nervous system may regulate endpoint stiffness via changes in muscle activation.},

@article{Quaia1998,
abstract = {One-dimensional models of oculomotor control rely on the fact that, when rotations around only one axis are considered, angular velocity is the derivative of orientation. However, when rotations around arbitrary axes [3-dimensional (3-D) rotations] are considered, this property does not hold, because 3-D rotations are noncommutative. The noncommutativity of rotations has prompted a long debate over whether or not the oculomotor system has to account for this property of rotations by employing noncommutative operators. Recently, Raphan presented a model of the ocular plant that incorporates the orbital pulleys discovered, and qualitatively modeled, by Miller and colleagues. Using one simulation, Raphan showed that the pulley model could produce realistic saccades even when the neural controller is commutative. However, no proof was offered that the good behavior of the Raphan-Miller pulley model holds for saccades different from those simulated. We demonstrate mathematically that the Raphan-Miller pulley model always produces movements that have an accurate dynamic behavior. This is possible because, if the pulleys are properly placed, the oculomotor plant (extraocular muscles, orbital pulleys, and eyeball) in a sense appears commutative to the neural controller. We demonstrate this finding by studying the effect that the pulleys have on the different components of the innervation signal provided by the brain to the extraocular muscles. Because the pulleys make the axes of action of the extraocular muscles dependent on eye orientation, the effect of the innervation signals varies correspondingly as a function of eye orientation. In particular, the Pulse of innervation, which in classical models of the saccadic system encoded eye velocity, here encodes a different signal, which is very close to the derivative of eye orientation. In contrast, the Step of innervation always encodes orientation, whether or not the plant contains pulleys. Thus the Step can be produced by simply integrating the Pulse. Particular care will be given to describing how the pulleys can have this differential effect on the Pulse and the Step. We will show that, if orbital pulleys are properly located, the neural control of saccades can be greatly simplified. Furthermore, the neural implementation of Listing's Law is simplified: eye orientation will lie in Listing's Plane as long as the Pulse is generated in that plane. These results also have implications for the surgical treatment of strabismus.},

abstract = {Based on recent experimental data, we have developed a conductance-based computational network model of the subthalamic nucleus and the external segment of the globus pallidus in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. Computer simulations and analysis of this model illuminate the roles of the coupling architecture of the network, and associated synaptic conductances, in modulating the activity patterns displayed by this network. Depending on the relationships of these coupling parameters, the network can support three general classes of sustained firing patterns: clustering, propagating waves, and repetitive spiking that may show little regularity or correlation. Each activity pattern can occur continuously or in discrete episodes. We characterize the mechanisms underlying these rhythms, as well as the influence of parameters on details such as spiking frequency and wave speed. These results suggest that the subthalamopallidal circuit is capable both of correlated rhythmic activity and of irregular autonomous patterns of activity that block rhythmicity. Increased striatal input to, and weakened intrapallidal inhibition within, the indirect pathway can switch the behavior of the circuit from irregular to rhythmic. This may be sufficient to explain the emergence of correlated oscillatory activity in the subthalamopallidal circuit after destruction of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease and in animal models of parkinsonism.},

The ratio of isometric tension to stiffness was plotted against tension over a wide range of muscle lengths and stimulus rates. The results fitted a straight line well, as predicted from crossbridge theory, showing the stiffness to be a function of tension only, independent of the combination of length and stimulus rate used to generate the tension. The major deviation from this line was attributed to incomplete fusion at low frequencies of stimulation. Values believed to be tendon compliance and crossbridge tension per unit of stiffness were found from the graph, and the tendon compliance correlated with the maximum muscle tension. Shortening the tendon by attaching nearer to the muscle changed the results in a manner consistent with the theory, provided that appropriate precautions were taken against slippage.},

In the majority of neurons that fired rebounds,E GABAA was equal to or more hyperpolarized than the hyperpolarization required for rebound burst firing.

abstract = {A great challenge for robotic systems is their ability to carry on complex manipulation and locomotion tasks while responding to the changing environment. To allow robots to oper- ate in human environments there is a strong need to develop new control architectures that can provide advanced task capabilities and interactive skills. These architectures must be effective in coordinating whole-body behaviors for various control objectives while comply- ing with balance stability, contact stance, and other dynamic constraints. In addition, to facilitate the integration of robots in human environments, it is desirable for their motions and task behaviors to be compatible with those of humans. In this thesis, we present a con- trol methodology for the synthesis of realtime whole-body control behaviors in humanoid systems. The work is presented in three parts. First, we establish mathematical foundations that characterize the kinematic and dy- namic behaviors of task and postural criteria under balance and contact stability constraints. We identify the dynamic behavior of postural tasks operating in the null space of operational tasks and we develop task-oriented controllers in postural space. These controllers are used to accomplish secondary goals or to optimize postural criteria without affecting priority tasks. Based on task and posture control decompositions we define recursive structures with multiple priority levels. These structures allow us to create controllers for all aspects of motion while ensuring that critical tasks are accomplished first. Exploiting prioritization, we address the control of dynamic constraints as priority tasks and we project operational tasks and postural criteria in the null space of all acting constraints. This strategy prevents lower priority tasks from violating the acting constraints. Second, we develop a variety of controllers to address the different aspects of the robots motion. We propose position and force controllers to control the various task effectors of the robot. We use potential fields to handle reactively dynamic constraints such as balance stability, joint limits, obstacle avoidance, and self collisions. We develop posture controllers to enhance overall performance in terms of available workspace, resemblance to iv human poses, and optimization of actuation effort. Third, we tackle the synthesis of com- plex whole-body behaviors. To facilitate the creation of behaviors we develop control and behavioral abstractions that encapsulate behavior representation and action mechanisms. These abstractions are designed to be instantiated and coordinated by high level decision and perceptual processes. The methods proposed throughout this dissertation provide numerous control tools and behavioral abstractions that will allow robots to deal effectively with the complexity and dynamism of human environments.},

abstract = {In musculoskeletal modelling, several optimization techniques are used to calculate muscle forces, which strongly influence resultant hip contact forces (HCF). The goal of this study was to calculate muscle forces using four different optimization techniques, i.e., two different static optimization techniques, computed muscle control (CMC) and the physiological inverse approach (PIA). We investigated their subsequent effects on HCFs during gait and sit to stand and found that at the first peak in gait at 15–20{\%} of the gait cycle, CMC calculated the highest HCFs (median 3.9 times peak GRF (pGRF)). When comparing calculated HCFs to experimental HCFs reported in literature, the former were up to 238{\%} larger. Both static optimization techniques produced lower HCFs (median 3.0 and 3.1 pGRF), while PIA included muscle dynamics without an excessive increase in HCF (median 3.2 pGRF). The increased HCFs in CMC were potentially caused by higher muscle forces resulting from co-contraction of agonists and antagonists around the hip. Alternatively, these higher HCFs may be caused by the slightly poorer tracking of the net joint moment by the muscle moments calculated by CMC. We conclude that the use of different optimization techniques affects calculated HCFs, and static optimization approached experimental values best.},

In this study, we developed a multivariable regression model to determine if biomechanical variables and other subject characteristics measured during a physical exam and gait analysis can predict which subjects with crouch gait will demonstrate improved knee kinematics on a follow-up gait analysis. We formulated the model and tested its performance by retrospectively analyzing 353 limbs of subjects who walked with crouch gait. The regression model was able to predict which subjects would demonstrate 'Improved' and 'Unimproved' knee kinematics with over 70{\%} accuracy, and was able to explain approximately 49{\%} of the variance in subjects' change in knee flexion between gait analyses. We found that improvement in stance phase knee flexion was positively associated with three variables that were drawn from knowledge about the biomechanical contributors to crouch gait: (i) adequate hamstrings lengths and velocities, possibly achieved via hamstrings lengthening surgery, (ii) normal tibial torsion, possibly achieved via tibial derotation osteotomy, and (iii) sufficient muscle strength. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Physiologists use these words routinely in their publications, in laboratory experiments and, indeed, like most lay people, in their daily lives. The tacit assumption is that we all know, more or less, what they mean. However, the issue has a rich history of philosophical and scientific debate; and, as this article demonstrates, present-day researchers still cannot reach a consensus on the meaning of the words and on whether it is possible to draw a scientific distinction between them. The five authors present five quite different analyses. In broad terms, they split into two camps: those who equate voluntary behaviours with consciousness and suppressibility and those who view all behaviours as sensorimotor interactions, the complexity of which determines whether they are reflexive or voluntary. According to the first view, most movements of daily life are neither purely reflex nor purely voluntary. They fall into the middle ground of automatic motor programs. According to the second view, as neuroscience advances the class of reflex behaviours will grow and the class of voluntary behaviours will shrink.},

abstract = {It is often important to include prestress in computational models of biological tissues. The prestress can represent residual stresses (stresses that exist after the tissue is excised from the body) or in situ stresses (stresses that exist in vivo, in the absence of loading). A prestressed reference configuration may also be needed when modeling the reference geometry of biological tissues in vivo. This research developed a general framework for representing prestress in finite element models of biological materials. It is assumed that the material is elastic, allowing the prestress to be represented via a prestrain. For prestrain fields that are not compatible with the reference geometry, the computational framework provides an iterative algorithm for updating the prestrain until equilibrium is satisfied. The iterative framework allows for enforcement of two different constraints: elimination of distortion in order to address the incompatibility issue, and enforcing a specified in situ fiber strain field while allowing for distortion. The framework was implemented as a plugin in FEBio (www.febio.org), making it easy to maintain the software and to extend the framework if needed. Several examples illustrate the application and effectiveness of the approach, including the application of in situ strains to ligaments in the Open Knee model (simtk.org/home/openknee). A novel method for recovering the stress-free configuration from the prestrain deformation gradient is also presented. This general purpose theoretical and computational framework for applying prestrain will allow analysts to overcome the challenges in modeling this important aspect of biological tissue mechanics.},

abstract = {Objective To compare performance error and perceived difficulty during toe-out gait modification in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) across 3 different types of visual feedback: mirror, raw video, and real-time biofeedback of toe-out angle.
Design Repeated-measures, within-subject trial.
Setting University motion analysis laboratory.
Participants Individuals with knee OA (N=20; 11 women; mean age, 65.4±9.8y) participated in this study. Seven participants had mild knee OA, 9 had moderate knee OA, and 4 had severe knee OA.
Interventions Participants were trained to walk on a treadmill while matching a target indicating a 10° increase in stance phase toe-out compared with toe-out angle measured during self-selected walking. The target was provided visually via the 3 types of feedback listed above and were presented in a random order.
Main Outcome Measures Kinematic data were collected and used to calculate the difference between the target angle and the actual performed angle for each condition (toe-out performance error). Difficulty was assessed using a numerical rating scale (0-10) provided verbally by participants.
Results Toe-out performance error was significantly less when using the real-time biofeedback method than when using the other 2 methods (P=.025; mean difference vs mirror=2.05°; mean difference vs raw video=1.51°). Perceived difficulty was not statistically different between the groups (P=.51).
Conclusions Although statistically significant, the 2° difference in toe-out gait performance error may not necessitate the large economic and personnel costs of real-time biofeedback as a means to modify movement in clinical or research settings.},

This is frustrating for those who would reanimate paralysed limbs either through promoting regeneration of the injured spinal cord or by functional electrical stimulation. The importance of and general role played by the spinal cord might be more easily recognized by analogy to marionette puppets, another system in which a brain (the puppeteer's) must cope with a large number of partially redundant actuators (strings) moving a mechanical linkage with complex intrinsic properties.},

abstract = {Synapses are highly plastic and are modified by changes in patterns of neural activity or sensory experience. Plasticity of cortical excitatory synapses is thought to be important for learning and memory, leading to alterations in sensory representations and cognitive maps. However, these changes must be coordinated across other synapses within local circuits to preserve neural coding schemes and the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, i.e., excitatory-inhibitory balance. Recent studies indicate that inhibitory synapses are also plastic and are controlled directly by a large number of neuromodulators, particularly during episodes of learning. Many modulators transiently alter excitatory-inhibitory balance by decreasing inhibition, and thus disinhibition has emerged as a major mechanism by which neuromodulation might enable long-term synaptic modifications naturally. This review examines the relationships between neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity, focusing on the induction of long-term changes that collectively enhance cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance for improving perception and behavior.

abstract = {In this critical narrative review, we examine the role of physical activity (PA), recreational and elite sports in the development of knee/hip osteoarthritis (OA), taking into account the role of injury in this relationship. The process of article selection was unsystematic. Articles were selected on the basis of the authors' expertise, self-knowledge, and reflective practice. In the general adult population, self-reported diagnosis of knee/hip OA was not associated with low, moderate or high levels of PA. For studies using radiographic knee/hip OA as a primary outcome, the incidence of asymptomatic radiographic OA was higher for subjects with the highest quartile of usual PA than the least active subjects. The risk of incident radiographic knee/hip OA features was increased for subjects with a history of regular sports participation (for osteophyte formation but not joint space narrowing). This risk depended on the type of sport (team and power sports but not endurance and running), and certain conditions (high level of practice) were closely related to the risk of injury. The prevalence of radiographic OA was significantly higher, especially the presence of osteophytes, in former elite athletes than controls. The risk of OA was higher with participation in mixed sports, especially soccer or power sports, than endurance sport. However, the prevalence of clinical OA between former elite athletes and controls was similar, with less hip/knee disability in former athletes. Moderate daily recreational or sport activities, whatever the type of sport, are not a consistent risk factor for clinical or radiographic knee/hip OA. Risk of injury in different sports may be the key factor to understanding the risk of OA related to sport.},

In this paper, the principle of least action is first treated with regard to holonomic constraints in multibody systems. A variant of this, the principle of least curvature or straightest path, is then investigated in the context of geodesic paths on constrained motion manifolds. Subsequently, task space descriptions are addressed and the operational space approach is interpreted in terms of least action. Task-level control is then applied to the problem of cost minimization. Finally, task-level optimization is formulated with respect to extremizing an objective criterion, where the criterion is interpreted as the action of the system. Examples are presented which illustrate these approaches.},

abstract = {Widespread use of gait or motion analysis in the diagnosis of patients with locomotor pathology and the subsequent planning and assessment of treatment has been limited because of its reliability, particularly in evaluating frontal and transverse plane components. This is because spatial reconstruction of the musculoskeletal system and calculation of its kinematics and kinetics via a skin marker-based multi-link model are subject to marker skin movement artefacts. Traditional methods treat each body segment separately without imposing joint constraints, resulting in apparent dislocations at joints predominantly because of skin movement artefacts. An optimisation method for the determination of the positions and orientations of multi-link musculoskeletal models from marker co-ordinates is presented. It is based on the minimisation of the weighted sum of squared distances between measured and model-determined marker positions. The model imposes joint constraints. Numerical experiments were performed to show that the new method is capable of eliminating joint dislocations and giving more accurate model position and orientation estimations. It is suggested that, with joint constraints and a global error compensation scheme, the effects of measurement errors on the reconstruction of the musculoskeletal system and subsequent mechanical analyses can be reduced globally. The proposed method minimises errors in axial rotation and ab/adduction at the joints and may extend the applicability of gait analysis to clinical problems.},

abstract = {Proprioceptive afferents from muscle spindles encode information about peripheral joint movements for the central nervous system (CNS). The sensitivity of muscle spindle is nonlinearly dependent on the activation of gamma ($\gamma$) motoneurons in the spinal cord that receives inputs from the motor cortex. How fusimotor control of spindle sensitivity affects proprioceptive coding of joint position is not clear. Furthermore, what information is carried in the fusimotor signal from the motor cortex to the muscle spindle is largely unknown. In this study, we addressed the issue of communication between the central and peripheral sensorimotor systems using a computational approach based on the virtual arm (VA) model. In simulation experiments within the operational range of joint movements, the gamma static commands ($\gamma$(s)) to the spindles of both mono-articular and bi-articular muscles were hypothesized (1) to remain constant, (2) to be modulated with joint angles linearly, and (3) to be modulated with joint angles nonlinearly. Simulation results revealed a nonlinear landscape of Ia afferent with respect to both $\gamma$(s) activation and joint angle. Among the three hypotheses, the constant and linear strategies did not yield Ia responses that matched the experimental data, and therefore, were rejected as plausible strategies of spindle sensitivity control. However, if $\gamma$(s) commands were quadratically modulated with joint angles, a robust linear relation between Ia afferents and joint angles could be obtained in both mono-articular and bi-articular muscles. With the quadratic strategy of spindle sensitivity control, $\gamma$(s) commands may serve as the CNS outputs that inform the periphery of central coding of joint angles. The results suggest that the information of joint angles may be communicated between the CNS and muscles via the descending $\gamma$(s) efferent and Ia afferent signals.},

abstract = {Previous studies using advanced matrix factorization techniques have shown that the coordination of human voluntary limb movements may be accomplished using combinations of a small number of intermuscular coordination patterns, or muscle synergies. However, the potential use of muscle synergies for isometric force generation has been evaluated mostly using correlational methods. The results of such studies suggest that fixed relationships between the activations of pairs of muscles are relatively rare. There is also emerging evidence that the nervous system uses independent strategies to control movement and force generation, which suggests that one cannot conclude a priori that isometric force generation is accomplished by combining muscle synergies, as shown in movement control. In this study, we used non-negative matrix factorization to evaluate the ability of a few muscle synergies to reconstruct the activation patterns of human arm muscles underlying the generation of three-dimensional (3-D) isometric forces at the hand. Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were recorded from eight key elbow and shoulder muscles during 3-D force target-matching protocols performed across a range of load levels and hand positions. Four synergies were sufficient to explain, on average, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} of the variance in EMG datasets. Furthermore, we found that muscle synergy composition was conserved across biomechanical task conditions, experimental protocols, and subjects. Our findings are consistent with the view that the nervous system can generate isometric forces by assembling a combination of a small number of muscle synergies, differentially weighted according to task constraints.},

abstract = {Human level of dexterity has not been duplicated in a robotic form to date. Dexterity is achieved in part due to the biomechanical structure of the human body and in part due to the neural control of movement. We have developed an anatomically correct testbed (ACT) hand to investigate the importance and behavioral consequences of anatomical features and neural control strategies of the human hand. One of the critical aspects of understanding dexterity is the analysis of the relationships between the hand muscle movements and joint movements, defined by the moment arms of the muscles. It is known that the moment arms for the hand muscles are configuration-dependent and vary substantially with change in posture. This paper presents a methodology for determining continuous variations in the moment arms with respect to multiple joints moving simultaneously. To determine variations in the moment arms of the ACT hand index finger muscles, we employed a nonparametric regression method called Gaussian processes (GPs). GPs give a functional mapping between the joint angles and muscle excursions, and the gradients of these mappings are the muscle moment arms. We compared the moment arm relationships of the ACT hand with those determined from the available cadaver data. We present the implications of the determination of variable moment arms toward understanding of the biomechanical properties of the human hand and for the neuromuscular control for the ACT hand index finger movements.},

abstract = {Understanding degeneration of biological and prosthetic knee joints requires knowledge of the in-vivo loading environment during activities of daily living. Musculoskeletal models can estimate medial/lateral tibiofemoral compartment contact forces, yet anthropometric differences between individuals make accurate predictions challenging. We developed a full-body OpenSim musculoskeletal model with a knee joint that incorporates subject-specific tibiofemoral alignment (i.e. knee varus-valgus) and geometry (i.e. contact locations). We tested the accuracy of our model and determined the importance of these subject-specific parameters by comparing estimated to measured medial and lateral contact forces during walking in an individual with an instrumented knee replacement and post-operative genu valgum (6??). The errors in the predictions of the first peak medial and lateral contact force were 12.4{\%} and 11.9{\%}, respectively, for a model with subject-specific tibiofemoral alignment and contact locations determined through radiographic analysis, vs. 63.1{\%} and 42.0{\%}, respectively, for a model with generic parameters. We found that each degree of tibiofemoral alignment deviation altered the first peak medial compartment contact force by 51N (r2=0.99), while each millimeter of medial-lateral translation of the compartment contact point locations altered the first peak medial compartment contact force by 41N (r2=0.99). The model, available at www.simtk.org/home/med-lat-knee/, enables the specification of subject-specific joint alignment and compartment contact locations to more accurately estimate medial and lateral tibiofemoral contact forces in individuals with non-neutral alignment.},

abstract = {Modern 3d applications convince through models with high polygon counts, detailed textures, and advanced lighting techniques. The results are closer to photographic realism than ever before. But so often this illusion of a virtual world is lost as soon as objects start to move and interact. One method to improve the believability of moving, interacting objects is simulation of physics. Idealization of real world objects helps to simplify and speed up the simulation. One important idealization is a rigid body – a body that never changes its shape. The majority of objects in interactive 3d applications can be treated as rigid bodies or systems of connected rigid bodies. Examples are barrels, bricks, rocks, cupboards with movable doors, and even humans and animals with movable limbs. These rigid bodies can collide with each other and are subject to forces, like gravity and friction, and constraints. Constraints are conditions that restrict the movement of bodies. For example, a joint constraint connects two bodies. This thesis summarizes the fundamentals of mechanics that are necessary to build a simulation of rigid body dynamics. A modular overview of the simulation process is given, and the state of the art simulation methods will be examined. With this knowledge a framework for the simulation of rigid body dynamics in interactive 3d applications is presented. The designed framework is independent of special simulation methods and allows incorporating all examined simulation methods and physical effects.},

abstract = {Electrical stimulation is a promising technology for the restoration of arm function in paralyzed individuals. Control of the paralyzed arm under electrical stimulation, however, is a challenging problem that requires advanced controllers and command interfaces for the user. A real-time model describing the complex dynamics of the arm would allow user-in-the-loop type experiments where the command interface and controller could be assessed. Real-time models of the arm previously described have not included the ability to model the independently controlled scapula and clavicle, limiting their utility for clinical applications of this nature. The goal of this study therefore was to evaluate the performance and mechanical behavior of a real-time, dynamic model of the arm and shoulder girdle. The model comprises seven segments linked by eleven degrees of freedom and actuated by 138 muscle elements. Polynomials were generated to describe the muscle lines of action to reduce computation time, and an implicit, first-order Rosenbrock formulation of the equations of motion was used to increase simulation step-size. The model simulated flexion of the arm faster than real time, simulation time being 92{\%} of actual movement time on standard desktop hardware. Modeled maximum isometric torque values agreed well with values from the literature, showing that the model simulates the moment-generating behavior of a real human arm. The speed of the model enables experiments where the user controls the virtual arm and receives visual feedback in real time. The ability to optimize potential solutions in simulation greatly reduces the burden on the user during development.},

abstract = {Thalamic relay nuclei transmit basal ganglia output to the frontal cortex, forming the last link in corticobasal ganglia circuitry. The thalamus regulates cortical activity through differential laminar connections, providing not only feedback, but also initiating "feedforward" loops, via nonreciprocal projections, that influence higher cortical areas. This study examines the organization of thalamic connections with cortex from basal ganglia relay nuclei, including ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei, in the Macaque monkey. Anterograde and bidirectional tracer injections ([3H]-amino acids, dextran conjugates of Fluorescein, Lucifer Yellow or FluoroRuby, or wheat germ agglutinin) into discrete VA/VL, MD, and frontal cortical sites demonstrate specific thalamocortical connections. VL projections target caudal motor areas (primary, supplementary, and caudal premotor areas), whereas VA projections target more rostral premotor areas (including cingulate and presupplementary motor areas) and MD projects to dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortices. Thalamocortical projections innervate cortical layers I and III, and to a lesser extent, layer V. In motor areas layer I projections are more extensive than those to layer III (and V). The complex laminar organization of projections from specific thalamic sites suggests differential regulation of cortical function. Injections of bidirectional tracers into thalamic and frontal cortical sites also show that in comparison to thalamocortical projections, corticothalamic projections to VA-VL and MD are more widespread. These findings demonstrate both reciprocal and nonreciprocal components to the thalamo-cortico-thalamic relay. Together, these experiments indicate a dual role for VA-VL and MD nuclei: (1) to relay basal ganglia output within specific cortical circuits and (2) to mediate information flow between cortical circuits.},

To understand how muscles contribute to propulsion (i.e., forward acceleration of the mass center) and support (i.e., upward acceleration of the mass center) during running we developed a three-dimensional muscle-actuated simulation of the running gait cycle. The simulation is driven by 92 musculotendon actuators of the lower extremities and torso and includes the dynamics of arm motion. We analyzed the simulation to determine how each muscle contributed to the acceleration of the body mass center. During the early part of the stance phase, the quadriceps muscle group was the largest contributor to braking (i.e., backward acceleration of the mass center) and support. During the second half of the stance phase, the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were the greatest contributors to propulsion and support. The arms did not contribute substantially to either propulsion or support, generating less than 1{\%} of the peak mass center acceleration. However, the arms effectively counterbalanced the vertical angular momentum of the lower extremities. Our analysis reveals that the quadriceps and plantarflexors are the major contributors to acceleration of the body mass center during running.},

While survivorship of these devices is good, a substantial number of patients report dissatisfaction with the outcome of their procedure. Knowledge of in vivo kinematics and joint loading will enable improvement in pre-clinical assessment and refinement of implant geometry. The purpose of this investigation was to describe the mechanics of total knee arthroplasty during a variety of activities of daily living. Estimates of muscle forces, tibial contact load, location, and pressure distribution was performed through a combination of mobile fluoroscopy data collection, musculoskeletal modeling and finite element simulation. For the activities evaluated, joint compressive load was greatest during walking down stairs, however the highest contact pressure occurred during chair rise/sit. The joint contact moment in the frontal plane was mainly varus for gait and walking down stairs, while it was valgus during chair rise/sit. Excursion of the center of pressure on the tibial component was similar during each activity and between the medial and lateral sides. The main determinants of center of pressure location were internal-external rotation, joint load, and tibial insert conformity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

While most cortical areas provide inputs to the basal ganglia, including frontal, parietal, temporal, and limbic cortices, the thalamic feedback is directed principally to frontal cortical areas, including prefrontal, premotor, and supplementary motor areas. This thalamic feedback, which parallels ascending cerebellar connections through the thalamus to primary motor cortex, involves the basal ganglia in motor function. Diseases of the basal ganglia result in profound movement disorders. However, the complexity and variety of such disorders makes characterizing a typical function elusive. Hypokinetic disorders predominate in some diseases, such as in Parkinson's disease, whereas hyperkinetic disorders are typical in Huntington's chorea and Tourette's syndrome. Unlike the cortex in which neurons are distributed in distinct layers that aid in the characterization of functionally distinct areas, the principal components of the basal ganglia are characterized by a homogeneity of neuronal distribution.},

abstract = {Purpose: Biomechanical modeling consistently indicates that superior oblique (SO) muscle weakness alone is insufficient to explain the large hypertropia often observed in SO muscle palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to investigate if any size or contractility changes in the inferior rectus (IR) muscle may contribute. Design: Prospective, case-control study. Participants: Seventeen patients with unilateral SO muscle palsy and 18 orthotropic subjects. Methods: Surface coils were used to obtain sets of contiguous, 2-mm-thick, high-resolution, coronal MRI views in different gazes. Cross-sectional areas of the IR and SO muscles were determined in supraduction and infraduction for evaluation of size and contractility. Diagnosis of SO muscle palsy was based on clinical presentations, subnormal contractility, and SO muscle size less than the normal 95{\%} confidence limit. Main Outcome Measures: Cross-sectional areas of the IR and SO muscles. Results: Patients had 15.9??7.2 prism diopters (??; mean??standard deviation) of central gaze hypertropia and exhibited ipsilesional SO muscle atrophy and subnormal contractility. Mean ipsilesional, contralesional, and normal IR muscle cross-sections were 28.5??3.5 mm{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}n 2, 31.9??3.8 mm{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}n 2, and 31.8??5.8 mm{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}n 2, whereas mean contractility was 16.5??3.8 mm{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}n 2, 20.5??4.1 mm{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}n 2, and 16.6??4.8 mm{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}n 2, respectively. Ipsilesional IR muscle cross-section and contractility was significantly less than contralesional cross-section and contractility (P{\textless}0.01). Conclusions: In SO muscle palsy, the contralesional IR muscle is larger and more contractile than the ipsilesional IR muscle, reflecting likely neurally mediated changes that augment the relatively small hypertropia resulting from SO muscle weakness alone. Recession of the hyperfunctioning contralesional IR muscle recession in SO muscle palsy is a physiologic therapy.

abstract = {In rhythmic movements, humans activate their muscles in a robust and energy efficient way. These activation patterns are oscillatory and seem to originate from neural networks in the spinal cord, called central pattern generators (CPGs). Evidence for the existence of CPGs was found for instance in lampreys, cats and rats. There are indications that CPGs exist in humans as well, but this is not proven yet. Energy efficiency is achieved by resonance tuning: the central nervous system is able to tune into the resonance frequency of the limb, which is determined by the local reflex gains. The goal of this study is to investigate if the existence of a CPG in the human spine can explain the resonance tuning behavior, observed in human rhythmic limb movement. A neuro-musculo-skeletal model of the forearm is proposed, in which a CPG is organized in parallel to the local reflexloop. The afferent and efferent connections to the CPG are based on clues about the organization of the CPG, found in literature. The model is kept as simple as possible (i.e., lumped muscle models, groups of neurons are lumped into half-centers, simple reflex model), but incorporates enough of the essential dynamics to explain behavior-such as resonance tuning-in a qualitative way. Resonance tuning is achieved above, at and below the endogenous frequency of the CPG in a highly non-linear neuro- musculo-skeletal model. Afferent feedback of muscle lengthening to the CPG is necessary to accomplish resonance tuning above the endogenous frequency of the CPG, while feedback of muscle velocity is necessary to compensate for the phase lag, caused by the time delay in the loop coupling the limb to the CPG. This afferent feedback of muscle lengthening and velocity represents the Ia and II fibers, which-according to literature-is the input to the CPG. An internal process of the CPG, which integrates the delayed muscle lengthening and feeds it to the half-center model, provides resonance tuning below the endogenous frequency. Increased co-contraction makes higher movement frequencies possible. This agrees with studies of rhythmic forearm movements, which have shown that co-contraction increases with movement frequency. Robustness against force perturbations originates mainly from the CPG and the local reflex loop. The CPG delivers an increasing part of the necessary muscle activation for increasing perturbation size. As far as we know, the proposed neuro-musculo-skeletal model is the first that explains the observed resonance tuning in human rhythmic limb movement.},

abstract = {Improving lower-limb flexion/extension angles during walking is important for the treatment of numerous pathologies. Currently, these gait retraining procedures are mostly qualitative, often based on visual assessment and oral instructions. This study aimed to propose an alternative method combining motion capture and display of target footprints on the floor. The second objectives were to determine the error in footprint modifications and the effects of footprint modifications on lower-limb flexion/extension angles. An augmented-reality system made of an optoelectronic motion capture device and video projectors displaying target footprints on the floor was designed. 10 young healthy subjects performed a series of 27 trials, consisting of increased and decreased amplitudes in stride length, step width and foot progression angle. 11 standard features were used to describe and compare lower-limb flexion/extension angles among footprint modifications. Subjects became accustomed to walk on target footprints in less than 10 min, with mean (± SD) precision of 0.020 ± 0.002 m in stride length, 0.022 ± 0.006 m in step width, and 2.7 ± 0.6° in progression angle. Modifying stride length had significant effects on 3/3 hip, 2/4 knee and 4/4 ankle features. Similarly, step width and progression angle modifications affected 2/3 and 1/3 hip, 2/4 and 1/4 knee as well as 3/4 and 2/4 ankle features, respectively. In conclusion, this study introduced an augmented-reality method allowing healthy subjects to modify their footprint parameters rapidly and precisely. Walking with modified footprints changed lower-limb sagittal-plane kinematics. Further research is needed to design rehabilitation protocols for specific pathologies.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that both $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ motoneurons are active during movement and posture, but how does the central motor system coordinate the $\alpha$-$\gamma$ controls in these tasks remains sketchy due to lack of in vivo data. Here a computational model of $\alpha$-$\gamma$ control of muscles and spindles was used to investigate $\alpha$-$\gamma$ integration and coordination for movement and posture. The model comprised physiologically realistic spinal circuitry, muscles, proprioceptors, and skeletal biomechanics. In the model, we divided the cortical descending commands into static and dynamic sets, where static commands ($\alpha$ s and $\gamma$ s ) were for posture maintenance and dynamic commands ($\alpha$ d and $\gamma$ d ) were responsible for movement. We matched our model to human reaching movement data by straightforward adjustments of descending commands derived from either minimal-jerk trajectories or human EMGs. The matched movement showed smooth reach-to-hold trajectories qualitatively close to human behaviors, and the reproduced EMGs showed the classic tri-phasic patterns. In particular, the function of $\gamma$ d was to gate the $\alpha$ d command at the propriospinal neurons (PN) such that antagonistic muscles can accelerate or decelerate the limb with proper timing. Independent control of joint position and stiffness could be achieved by adjusting static commands. Deefferentation in the model indicated that accurate static commands of $\alpha$ s and $\gamma$ s are essential to achieve stable terminal posture precisely, and that the $\gamma$ d command is as important as the $\alpha$ d command in controlling antagonistic muscles for desired movements. Deafferentation in the model showed that losing proprioceptive afferents mainly affected the terminal position of movement, similar to the abnormal behaviors observed in human and animals. Our results illustrated that tuning the simple forms of $\alpha$-$\gamma$ commands can reproduce a range of human reach-to-hold movements, and it is necessary to coordinate the set of $\alpha$-$\gamma$ descending commands for accurate and stable control of movement and posture.},

abstract = {Finding the relationship between two coordinate systems using pairs of measurements of the coordinates of a number of points in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 × 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

abstract = {To manipulate objects or to use tools we must compensate for any forces arising from interaction with the physical environment. Recent studies indicate that this compensation is achieved by learning an internal model of the dynamics, that is, a neural representation of the relation between motor command and movement. In these studies interaction with the physical environment was stable, but many common tasks are intrinsically unstable. For example, keeping a screwdriver in the slot of a screw is unstable because excessive force parallel to the slot can cause the screwdriver to slip and because misdirected force can cause loss of contact between the screwdriver and the screw. Stability may be dependent on the control of mechanical impedance in the human arm because mechanical impedance can generate forces which resist destabilizing motion. Here we examined arm movements in an unstable dynamic environment created by a robotic interface. Our results show that humans learn to stabilize unstable dynamics using the skillful and energy-efficient strategy of selective control of impedance geometry.},

abstract = {1. We investigated the electrical properties of globus pallidus neurons intracellularly using brain slices from adult guinea pigs. Three types of neurons were identified according to their intrinsic electrophysiological properties. 2. Type I neurons (59{\%}) were silent at the resting membrane level (-65 +/- 10 mV, mean +/- SD) and generated a burst of spikes, with strong accommodation, to depolarizing current injection. Calcium-dependent low-frequency (1-8 Hz) membrane oscillations were often elicited by membrane depolarization (-53 +/- 8 mV). A low-threshold calcium conductance and an A-current were also identified. The mean input resistance of this neuronal type was 70 +/- 22 M omega. 3. Type II neurons (37{\%}) fired spontaneously at the resting membrane level (-59 +/- 9 mV). Their repetitive firing ({\textless} or = 200 Hz) was very sensitive to the amplitude of injected current and showed weak accommodation. Sodium-dependent high-frequency (20-100 Hz) subthreshold membrane oscillations were often elicited by membrane depolarization. This neuronal type demonstrated a low-threshold calcium spike and had the highest input resistance (134 +/- 62 M omega) of the three neuron types. 4. Type III neurons (4{\%}) did not fire spontaneously at the resting membrane level (-73 +/- 5 mV). Their action potentials were characterized by a long duration (2.3 +/- 0.6 ms). Repetitive firing elicited by depolarizing current injection showed weak or no accommodation. This neuronal type had an A-current and showed the lowest input resistance (52 +/- 35 M omega) of the three neuron types. 5. Stimulation of the caudoputamen evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in Type I and II neurons. In Type II neurons the IPSPs were usually followed by rebound firing. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials and antidromic responses were also elicited in some Type I and II neurons. The estimated conduction velocity of the striopallidal projection was {\textless} 1 m/s (Type I neurons, 0.49 +/- 0.37 m/s; Type II neurons, 0.33 +/- 0.13 m/s).},

abstract = {The development of legged robots for complex environments requires con- trollers that guarantee both high tracking performance and compliance with the environment. More specifically the control of the contact interaction with the envi- ronment is of crucial importance to ensure stable, robust and safe motions. In this contribution we develop an inverse dynamics controller for floating-base robots un- der contact constraints that can minimize any combination of linear and quadratic costs in the contact constraints and the commands. Our main result is the exact analytical derivation of the controller. Such a result is particularly relevant for legged robots as it allows us to use torque redundancy to directly optimize contact interactions. For example, given a desired locomotion behavior, we can guarantee the minimization of contact forces to reduce slipping on difficult terrains while en- suring high tracking performance of the desired motion. The main advantages of the controller are its simplicity, computational efficiency and robustness to model inaccuracies. We present detailed experimental results on simulated humanoid and quadruped robots as well as a real quadruped robot. The experiments demonstrate that the controller can greatly improve the robustness of locomotion of the robots.},

abstract = {A salient feature of human motor skill learning is the ability to exploit similarities across related tasks. In biological motor control, it has been hypothesized that muscle synergies, coherent activations of groups of muscles, allow for exploiting shared knowledge. Recent studies have shown that a rich set of complex motor skills can be generated by a combination of a small number of muscle synergies. In robotics, dynamic movement primitives are commonly used for motor skill learning. This machine learning approach implements a stable attractor system that facilitates learning and it can be used in high-dimensional continuous spaces. However, it does not allow for reusing shared knowledge, i.e., for each task an individual set of parameters has to be learned. We propose a novel movement primitive representation that employs parametrized basis functions, which combines the benefits of muscle synergies and dynamic movement primitives. For each task a superposition of synergies modulates a stable attractor system. This approach leads to a compact representation of multiple motor skills and at the same time enables efficient learning in high-dimensional continuous systems. The movement representation supports discrete and rhythmic movements and in particular includes the dynamic movement primitive approach as a special case. We demonstrate the feasibility of the movement representation in three multi-task learning simulated scenarios. First, the characteristics of the proposed representation are illustrated in a point-mass task. Second, in complex humanoid walking experiments, multiple walking patterns with different step heights are learned robustly and efficiently. Finally, in a multi-directional reaching task simulated with a musculoskeletal model of the human arm, we show how the proposed movement primitives can be used to learn appropriate muscle excitation patterns and to generalize effectively to new reaching skills.},

abstract = {Subthalamic neurons drive basal ganglia output neurons in resting animals and relay cortical and thalamic activity to the same output neurons during movement. The first objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms underlying the spontaneous activity of subthalamic neurons in vitro and to gain insight into their resting discharge in vivo. The second objective was to determine the response of subthalamic neurons to depolarizing current injection and how intrinsic properties may shape their response to cortical and thalamic inputs during movement. Cell-attached and whole-cell recordings were made from subthalamic neurons in brain slices prepared from 3- to 4-week-old rats. The slow, rhythmic discharge of subthalamic neurons was resistant to blockade of excitatory synaptic transmission indicating that intrinsic currents underlie their spontaneous discharge. A persistent sodium current was the source of current during the depolarizing phase of the oscillation. A powerful afterhyperpolarization following each action potential was sufficient to terminate the depolarization. A long duration component of the spike afterhyperpolarization determined the period of the oscillation and was generated by an apamin-sensitive calcium-activated potassium current. Calcium entry responsible for that current was associated with action potentials. Subthalamic neurons exhibited a sigmoidal frequency-current relationship with the steeper portion starting at approximately 30-40 Hz. This property makes subthalamic neurons more sensitive to input at high firing rates associated with movement than at low rates associated with rest. We propose that the subthreshold persistent sodium current overcomes calcium activated potassium current which accumulates during high frequency firing and underlies the enhanced sensitivity to current {\textgreater}30 Hz.},

abstract = {We constructed a physiologically realistic model of a lower-limb, mammalian muscle spindle composed of mathematical elements closely related to the anatomical components found in the biological spindle. The spindle model incorporates three nonlinear intrafusal fiber models (bag(1), bag(2), and chain) that contribute variously to action potential generation of primary and secondary afferents. A single set of model parameters was optimized on a number of data sets collected from feline soleus muscle, accounting accurately for afferent activity during a variety of ramp, triangular, and sinusoidal stretches. We also incorporated the different temporal properties of fusimotor activation as observed in the twitchlike chain fibers versus the toniclike bag fibers. The model captures the spindle's behavior both in the absence of fusimotor stimulation and during activation of static or dynamic fusimotor efferents. In the case of simultaneous static and dynamic fusimotor efferent stimulation, we demonstrated the importance of including the experimentally observed effect of partial occlusion. The model was validated against data that originated from the cat's medial gastrocnemius muscle and were different from the data used for the parameter determination purposes. The validation record included recently published experiments in which fusimotor efferent and spindle afferent activities were recorded simultaneously during decerebrate locomotion in the cat. This model will be useful in understanding the role of the muscle spindle and its fusimotor control during both natural and pathological motor behavior.},

abstract = {In two phases, we develop increasingly complex neural network models of spinal circuitry that self-organizes into networks with opponent channels for the control of an antagonistic muscle pair. The self-organization is enabled by a Hebbian learning rule operating during spontaneous activity present in the spinal cord. After the self-organized development, the networks enable independent control of the length and tension of the innervated muscles. This allows higher centers to hold joint angle invariant while varying joint stiffness and vice versa. The first network comprises only spontaneous activity generators, motorneurons, and inhibitory interneurons through which the two channels interact. The inhibitory interneurons enhance reciprocal action, and prevent saturation of the motorneuron pools, which is a necessary condition for independent control. In the second network, the neurons in the motorneuron pools obey the size-principle, which, when added by itself, leads to a loss of the desired invariance property. To restore the desired invariance, the second network further incorporated inhibitory interneurons analogous to Renshaw cells. The results obtained from the two models compare favourably with the FLETE-model for spinal circuitry (Bullock and Contreras- Vidal, 1993; Bullock et al., 1992; Bullock and Grossberg, 1991) which, although successful in explaining several phenomena related to motor control, did not self-organize its connection weights. Finally, we suggest ways in which this research could be applied in technology.},

In this conception, control refers to stabilization, so that lack of control implies reduced stability. The method was used to analyze an experiment on the sit-to-stand transition. By testing different hypotheses about the controlled variables, we systematically approximated the structure of control in joint space. We found that, for the task of sit-to-stand, the position of the center of mass in the sagittal plane was controlled.

abstract = {Postural balance and gait training is important for treating persons with functional impairments, however current systems are generally not portable and are unable to train different types of movements. This paper describes a proof-of-concept design of a configurable, wearable sensing and feedback system for real-time postural balance and gait training targeted for home-based treatments and other portable usage. Sensing and vibrotactile feedback are performed via eight distributed, wireless nodes or “Dots” (size: 22.5 × 20.5 × 15.0 mm, weight: 12.0 g) that can each be configured for sensing and/or feedback according to movement training requirements. In the first experiment, four healthy older adults were trained to reduce medial-lateral (M/L) trunk tilt while performing balance exercises. When trunk tilt deviated too far from vertical (estimated via a sensing Dot on the lower spine), vibrotactile feedback (via feedback Dots placed on the left and right sides of the lower torso) cued participants to move away from the vibration and back toward the vertical no feedback zone to correct their posture. A second experiment was conducted with the same wearable system to train six healthy older adults to alter their foot progression angle in real-time by internally or externally rotating their feet while walking. Foot progression angle was estimated via a sensing Dot adhered to the dorsal side of the foot, and vibrotactile feedback was provided via feedback Dots placed on the medial and lateral sides of the mid-shank cued participants to internally or externally rotate their foot away from vibration. In the first experiment, the wearable system enabled participants to significantly reduce trunk tilt and increase the amount of time inside the no feedback zone. In the second experiment, all participants were able to adopt new gait patterns of internal and external foot rotation within two minutes of real-time training with the wearable system.

abstract = {One approach to compute the musculotendon forces that underlie human motion is to combine an inverse dynamic analysis with a static optimisation procedure. Although computationally efficient, this classical inverse approach fails to incorporate constraints imposed by muscle physiology. The present paper reports on a physiological inverse approach (PIA) that combines an inverse dynamic analysis with a dynamic optimisation procedure. This allows the incorporation of a full description of muscle activation and contraction dynamics, without loss of computational efficiency. A comparison of muscle excitations and MT-forces predicted by the classical and the PIA is presented for normal and pathological gait. Inclusion of muscle physiology primarily affects the rate of active muscle force build-up and decay and allows the estimation of passive muscle force. Consequently, it influences the onset and cessation of the predicted muscle excitations as well as the level of co-contraction.},

abstract = {The exquisite mechanical functionality and versatility of the human hand emerges from complex neuro-musculo-skeletal interactions that are not completely understood. I have found it useful to work within a theoretical/experimental paradigm that outlines the fundamental neuro-musculo-skeletal components and their interactions. In this integrative paradigm, the laws of mechanics, the specifications of the manipulation task, and the sensorimotor signals define the interactions among hand anatomy, the nervous system, and manipulation function. Thus, our collaborative research activities emphasize a firm grounding in the mechanics of finger function, insistence on anatomical detail, and meticulous characterization of muscle activity. This overview of our work on precision pinch (i.e., the ability to produce and control fingertip forces) presents some of our findings around three Research Themes: Mechanics-based quantification of manipulation ability; Anatomically realistic musculoskeletal finger models; and Neural control of finger muscles. I conclude that (i) driving the fingers to some limit of sensorimotor performance is instrumental to elucidating motor control strategies; (ii) that the cross-over of tendons from flexors to extensors in the extensor mechanism is needed to produce force in every direction, and (iii) the anatomical routing of multiarticular muscles makes co-contraction unavoidable for many tasks. Moreover, creating realistic and clinically useful finger models still requires developing new computational means to simulate the viscoelastic tendinous networks of the extensor mechanism, and the muscle-bone-ligament interactions in complex articulations. Building upon this neuromuscular biomechanics paradigm is of immense clinical relevance: it will be instrumental to the development of clinical treatments to preserve and restore manual ability in people suffering from neurological and orthopedic conditions. This understanding will also advance the design and control of robotic hands whose performance lags far behind that of their biological counterparts. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To define the accuracy of clinical tests for assessing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. BACKGROUND: The cruciate ligaments, and especially the ACL, are among the most commonly injured structures of the knee. Given the increasing injury prevalence, there is undoubtedly a growing need for clinical decision making of health care providers. We reviewed the literature to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical examination for assessing ACL ruptures. METHODS AND MEASURES: MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1989 to April 2005), and CINAHL (1982 to April 2005) searches were performed. Also reference lists of the included studies were reviewed. Studies selected for data extraction were those that addressed the accuracy of at least 1 physical diagnostic test for ACL rupture and compared the performance of the clinical examination of the knee with a reference standard, such as arthroscopy, arthrotomy, or MRI. Searching was limited to English, German, and Dutch languages. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies that assessed the accuracy of clinical tests for diagnosing ACL ruptures met the inclusion criteria. Study results were, however, heterogeneous. The Lachman test is the most valid test to determine ACL tears, showing a pooled sensitivity of 85{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 83-87) and a pooled specificity of 94{\%} (95{\%} CI, 92-95). The pivot shift test is very specific, namely 98{\%} (95{\%} CI, 96-99), but has a poor sensitivity of 24{\%} (95{\%} CI, 21-27). The anterior drawer test shows good sensitivity and specificity in chronic conditions, respectively 92{\%} (95{\%} CI, 88-95) and 91{\%} (95{\%} CI, 87-94), but not in acute conditions. CONCLUSION: In case of suspected ACL injury it is recommended to perform the Lachman test. Because the pivot shift test is very specific both in acute as well as in chronic conditions, it is recommended to perform the pivot shift test as well.},

abstract = {Biomechanical models of the musculoskeletal system are frequently used to study neuromuscular control and simulate surgical procedures. To be broadly applicable, a model must be accessible to users, provide accurate representations of muscles and joints, and capture important interactions between joints. We have developed a model of the upper extremity that includes 15 degrees of freedom representing the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, thumb, and index finger, and 50 muscle compartments crossing these joints. The kinematics of each joint and the force-generating parameters for each muscle were derived from experimental data. The model estimates the muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms for each of the muscles over a wide range of postures. Given a pattern of muscle activations, the model also estimates muscle forces and joint moments. The moment arms and maximum moment-generating capacity of each muscle group (e.g., elbow flexors) were compared to experimental data to assess the accuracy of the model. These comparisons showed that moment arms and joint moments estimated using the model captured important features of upper extremity geometry and mechanics. The model also revealed coupling between joints, such as increased passive finger flexion moment with wrist extension. The computer model is available to researchers at http://nmbl.stanford.edu.},

abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) whole body multi-segment model for inverse dynamics analysis over a complete gait cycle, based only on measured kinematic data. The sequence of inverse dynamics calculations differs significantly from the conventional application of inverse dynamics using force plate data. A new validated "Smooth Transition Assumption" was used to solve the indeterminacy problem in the double support phase. Kinematic data is required for all major body segments and, hence, a whole body gait measurement protocol is presented. Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of digital filtering and body segment parameters on the accuracy of the prediction results. The model gave reasonably good estimates of sagittal plane ground forces and moment; however, the estimates in the other planes were less good, which we believe is largely due to their small magnitudes in comparison to the sagittal forces and moment. The errors observed are most likely caused by errors in the kinematic data resulting from skin movement artefact and by errors in the estimated body segment parameters. A digital filtering cut-off frequency of 4.5 Hz was found to produce the best results. It was also shown that errors in the mass properties of body segments can play a crucial role, with changes in properties sometimes having a disproportionate effect on the calculated ground reactions. The implication of these results is that, even when force plate data is available, the estimated joint forces are likely to suffer from similar errors.},

Applying the method to well-known spline curves (such as Bezier, Hermite, and B-spline curves), we are able ´ to construct various unit quaternion curves which share many important differential properties with their original curves. Many of our naive common beliefs in geometry break down even in the simple non-Euclidean spaceS 3 orSO(3). For example, the de Casteljau type construction of cubic B-spline quaternion curves does not preserveC 2 -continuity [10]. Through the use of decomposition into simple primitive quaternion curves, our quaternion curves preserve most of the algebraic and differential properties of the original spline curves.},

Collision avoidance, tradi tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial patential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper ational space—the space in which the task is originally described—rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot.

In both cases the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is employed to determine the biases associated to each accelerometer and gyro in the inertial measurement unit (IMU), together with high sampling-rate trajectory reconstruction from low frequency sampled GPS data. A comparison between UKF and the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) shows that the former outperforms the latter in the presence of high noise level and large initialization error, sensitivity to the tuning of covariance matrices, and joint estimation of IMU bias terms. Furthermore, substantial accuracy improvement due to the adoption of the unscented Kalman smoother (UKS) for high sampling-rate FPR is quantified, whereas the same cannot be claimed on the use of an iterated filtering approach. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Actively developed horizontal muscle forces and tissue stiffnesses were measured in 29 normal orthophoric volunteer subjects (18 to 33 years old) by means of noninvasive length-tension forceps. Mean active fixation force developed at 50 deg extreme gaze was 26{\%} greater for the medial rectus (74.8 gm) than for the lateral rectus (59.1 gm). The variation of maximum active force among individuals was 2:1 (48 to 103 gm). These muscles developed up to 25{\%} of their maximum active force out of their field of action. Active (counter) hysteresis force differences of over 10 gm were measured between nasal and temporal gaze directions. This study suggests that a muscle which develops a maximum active force of less than 45 gm would be suspect as paretic. Variations from the normal pattern of reciprocal innervation, reflected in the graded active force of individual muscle contraction, may help in understanding some types of oculomotor pathology. The mean tissue stiffness-restraining movement of the globe in the nasal direction (1.05 gm/deg) is 11{\%} greater than in the temporal direction (0.94 gm/deg). This is consistent with a stronger medial rectus balanced by a greater load. Variation of stiffness of 2:1 was observed among individuals; 0.8 to 1.7 gm/deg pulling nasally and 0.77 to 1.2 gm/deg temporally. Passive hysteresis and viscous force differences of over 10 gm were observed between the passive forced pull and normal spring-return of the eye. Large stiffnesses may be normal if balanced by large active forces. Abrupt changes of the length-tension curve indicate the magnitude and location of restrictions.},

abstract = {In this study, we review existing evidence on the history dependence of skeletal muscle force production. Specifically, we investigate the steady-state forces following shortening or stretching of an activated skeletal muscle preparation and compare these forces to the corresponding steady-state forces obtained for purely isometric contractions at identical lengths. Force depression following shortening and force enhancement following stretch can reach values of almost 50{\%} of the corresponding isometric reference force, and thus might affect movement control. We also show novel results on history-dependent effects for voluntary contractions in human skeletal muscles, thereby emphasizing that voluntary force production is affected by the contractile history of the target muscles. These results lead to the conclusion that history-dependent force production should be considered in models of movement control and voluntary force production.},

abstract = {Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) located in the skeletal muscles provide the central nervous system with information about muscle tension. The ensemble firing of all GTO receptors in the muscle has been hypothesized to represent a reliable measure of the whole muscle force but the precision and accuracy of that information are largely unknown because it is impossible to record activity simultaneously from all GTOs in a muscle. In this study, we combined a new mathematical model of force sampling and transduction in individual GTOs with various models of motor unit (MU) organization and recruitment simulating various normal, pathological and neural prosthetic conditions. Our study suggests that in the intact muscle the ensemble GTO activity accurately encodes force information according to a nonlinear, monotonic relationship that has its steepest slope for low force levels and tends to saturate at the highest force levels. The relationship between the aggregate GTO activity and whole muscle tension under some pathological conditions is similar to one seen in the intact muscle during rapidly modulated, phasic excitation of the motor pool (typical for many natural movements) but quite different when the muscle is activated slowly or held at a given force level. Substantial deviations were also observed during simulated functional electrical stimulation.},

abstract = {Multibody dynamic musculoskeletal models capable of predicting muscle forces and joint contact pressures simultaneously would be valuable for studying clinical issues related to knee joint degeneration and restoration. Current three-dimensional multibody knee models are either quasi-static with deformable contact or dynamic with rigid contact. This study proposes a computationally efficient methodology for combining multibody dynamic simulation methods with a deformable contact knee model. The methodology requires preparation of the articular surface geometry, development of efficient methods to calculate distances between contact surfaces, implementation of an efficient contact solver that accounts for the unique characteristics of human joints, and specification of an application programming interface for integration with any multibody dynamic simulation environment. The current implementation accommodates natural or artificial tibiofemoral joint models, small or large strain contact models, and linear or nonlinear material models. Applications are presented for static analysis (via dynamic simulation) of a natural knee model created from MRI and CT data and dynamic simulation of an artificial knee model produced from manufacturer's CAD data. Small and large strain natural knee static analyses required 1 min of CPU time and predicted similar contact conditions except for peak pressure, which was higher for the large strain model. Linear and nonlinear artificial knee dynamic simulations required 10 min of CPU time and predicted similar contact force and torque but different contact pressures, which were lower for the nonlinear model due to increased contact area. This methodology provides an important step toward the realization of dynamic musculoskeletal models that can predict in vivo knee joint motion and loading simultaneously.},

abstract = {Dexterous manipulation with a highly redundant movement system is one of the hallmarks of human motor skills. From numerous behavioral studies, there is strong evidence that humans employ compliant task space control, i.e. they focus control only on task variables while keeping redundant degrees-of-freedom as compliant as possible. This strategy is robust towards unknown disturbances and simultaneously safe for the operator and the environment. The theory of operational space control in robotics aims to achieve similar performance properties. However, despite various compelling theoretical lines of research, advanced operational space control is hardly found in actual robotics implementations, in particular new kinds of robots like humanoids and service robots, which would strongly profit from compliant dexterous manipulation. To analyze the pros and cons of different approaches to operational space control, this paper focuses on a theoretical and empirical evaluation of different methods that have been suggested in the literature, but also some new variants of operational space controllers. We address formulations at the velocity, acceleration, and force levels. First, we formulate all controllers in a common notational framework, including quaternion-based orientation control, and discuss some of their theoretical properties. Second, we present experimental comparisons of these approaches on a seven-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm with several benchmark tasks. As an aside, we also introduce a novel parameter estimation algorithm for rigid body dynamics, which ensures physical consistency, as this issue was crucial for our successful robot implementations. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that one of the simplified acceleration-based approaches can be advantageous in terms of task performance, ease of parameter tuning, and general robustness and compliance in the face of inevitable modeling errors.},

We asked the question: are the lines of action of hip joint muscles such that edge loading can occur in a well-designed, well-positioned acetabular cup? A musculoskeletal model, based on cadaveric lower limb geometry, was used to calculate for each muscle, in every position within the complete range of motion, whether its contraction would safely pull the femoral head into the cup or contribute to edge loading. The results show that all the muscles that insert into the distal femur, patella, or tibia could cause edge loading of a well-positioned cup when the hip is in deep flexion. Patients frequently use distally inserting muscles for movements requiring deep hip flexion, such as sit-to-stand. Importantly, the results, which are supported by in vivo data and clinical findings, also show that risk of edge loading is dramatically reduced by combining deep hip flexion with hip abduction. Patients, including those with sub-optimally positioned cups, may be able to reduce the prevalence of edge loading by rising from chairs or stooping with the hip abducted.},

abstract = {1. The locus of activity within the superior colliculus (SC) is related to the desired displacement of the eye. Current hypotheses suggest that the location of this locus of activity determines the amplitude of the saccade and that the level of activity at this locus determines eye velocity. We present evidence that suggests that, although the locus determines the amplitude of the saccade, the level of activity in the colliculus encodes dynamic motor error (the difference between desired and current eye displacement). 2. We categorized 86 neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus of two rhesus monkeys by their activity in relation to the end of saccadic eye movements. In 36{\%} of the cells (n = 31), activity was completely cut off by the end of the saccade (clipped cells). For 53{\%} of cells (n = 46), the major burst of activity ceased by the end of the saccade, but activity continued for 30-100 ms after the end of the movement (partially clipped cells). The remaining 10{\%} of the cells (n = 9) had no clear burst of activity (unclipped cells) but rather had activity that increased gradually before the saccade and then slowly decreased for up to 100 ms after the saccade. These categories were part of a continuum of cell types rather than discrete classes of cells. 3. We first determined whether this new categorization of cells revealed a special relation between the discharge of clipped and partially clipped cells and saccadic amplitude and peak velocity. As expected, we found a steady increase in spike count as saccadic amplitude increased up to the center of the movement field, and an increase in peak spike discharge as peak velocity increased up to a maximum radial eye velocity. Variability in the cell discharge was substantially greater than the variability of saccadic amplitude or peak velocity. We concluded that these single point or averaged measures did not reveal any new functional relationship of these cells. 4. We then examined the relationship of the temporal pattern of discharge of clipped and partially clipped cells to instantaneous changes in radial error and radial velocity. There was a monotonic decay in spike discharge with declining radial error. In contrast, there was a complex, multivalued relationship between spike discharge and radial velocity; collicular cells produced two different values of spike discharge for the same velocity, one during acceleration and the other during deceleration of the eye during a saccade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The design of control systems for limb prostheses seems likely to benefit from an understanding of how sensorimotor integration is achieved in the intact system. Traditional BMIs guess what movement parameters are encoded by brain activity and then decode them to drive prostheses directly. Modeling the known structure and emergent properties of the biological decoder itself is likely to be more effective in bridging from normal brain activity to functionally useful limb movement. In this study, we have extended a model of spinal circuitry (termed SLR for spinal-like regulator; see Raphael, G., Tsianos, G. A., {\&} Loeb G. E. 2010, Spinal-like regulator facilitates control of a two-degree-of-freedom wrist. The Journal of Neuroscience, 30(28), 9431-9444.) to a planar elbow-shoulder system to investigate how the spinal cord contributes to the control of a musculoskeletal system with redundant and multiarticular musculature and interaction (Coriolis) torques, which are common control problems for multisegment linkages throughout the body. The SLR consists of a realistic set of interneuronal pathways (monosynaptic Ia-excitatory, reciprocal Ia-inhibitory, Renshaw inhibitory, Ib-inhibitory, and propriospinal) that are driven by unmodulated step commands with learned amplitudes. We simulated the response of a planar arm to a brief, oblique impulse at the hand and investigated the role of cocontraction in learning to resist it. Training the SLR without cocontraction led to generally poor performance that was significantly worse than training with cocontraction. Further, removing cocontraction from the converged solutions and retraining the system achieved better performance than the SLR responses without cocontraction. Cocontraction appears to reshape the solution space, virtually eliminating the probability of entrapment in poor local minima. The local minima that are entered during learning with cocontraction are favorable starting points for learning to perform the task when cocontraction is abruptly removed. Given the control system's ability to learn effectively and rapidly, we hypothesize that it will generalize more readily to the wider range of tasks that subjects must learn to perform, as opposed to BMIs mapped to outputs of the musculoskeletal system. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents studies of the coordination of voluntary human arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles; curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle) have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature; at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced; the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed.},

The model is an integration of a biologically realistic neural network consisting of motoneurons and interneurons, modeling 12 populations of spinal neurons, and a one degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model, including proprioceptors. The model could mimic the findings of human postural experiments, using presynaptic inhibition of the Ia afferents to modulate the feedback gains. In a pathological case, disabling one specific neural connection between the inhibitory interneurons and the motoneurons could mimic the experimental findings in complex regional pain syndrome patients. It is concluded that the model is a valuable tool to gain insight into the spinal contributions to human motor control.

abstract = {Musculoskeletal models are powerful tools that allow biomechanical investigations and predictions of muscle forces not accessible with experiments. A core challenge modelers must confront is validation. Measurements of muscle activity and joint loading are used for qualitative and indirect validation of muscle force predictions. Subject-specific models have reached high levels of complexity and can predict contact loads with surprising accuracy. However, every deterministic musculoskeletal model contains an intrinsic uncertainty due to the high number of parameters not identifiable in vivo. The objective of this work is to test the impact of intrinsic uncertainty in a scaled-generic model on estimates of muscle and joint loads. Uncertainties in marker placement, limb coronal alignment, body segment parameters, Hill-type muscle parameters, and muscle geometry were modeled with a global probabilistic approach (multiple uncertainties included in a single analysis). 5-95{\%} confidence bounds and input/output sensitivities of predicted knee compressive loads and varus/valgus contact moments were estimated for a gait activity of three subjects with telemetric knee implants from the "Grand Challenge Competition." Compressive load predicted for the three subjects showed confidence bounds of 333 ± 248 N, 408 ± 333 N, and 379 ± 244 N when all the sources of uncertainty were included. The measured loads lay inside the predicted 5-95{\%} confidence bounds for 77{\%}, 83{\%}, and 76{\%} of the stance phase. Muscle maximum isometric force, muscle geometry, and marker placement uncertainty most impacted the joint load results. This study demonstrated that identification of these parameters is crucial when subject-specific models are developed.},

abstract = {Most studies on adaptive coordination of multi-robot systems assume exact knowledge of system kinematics and deal only with dynamic uncertainties. However, many industrial applications involve tasks in which a multi-robot system interacts with geometrically unknown environments. In this paper, we consider a multi-robot system grasping a rigid object in contact with a geometrically unknown surface. The proposed adaptive hybrid force-motion controller guarantees asymptotic tracking of desired motion and force trajectories while ensuring exact identification of constraint Jacobian matrix without persistency of excitation condition. The control signal is smooth and does not depend on contact force derivative. The proposed adaptive controller is robustified against environmental friction and nonparametric uncertainty in environment geometry. Simulation examples are presented to illustrate the results.},

abstract = {Impairment of the human neuromusculoskeletal system can lead to significant mobility limitations and decreased quality of life. Computational models that accurately represent the musculoskeletal systems of individual patients could be used to explore different treatment options and optimize clinical outcome. The most significant barrier to model-based treatment design is validation of model-based estimates of in vivo contact and muscle forces. This paper introduces an annual "Grand Challenge Competition to Predict In Vivo Knee Loads" based on a series of comprehensive publicly available in vivo data sets for evaluating musculoskeletal model predictions of contact and muscle forces in the knee. The data sets come from patients implanted with force-measuring tibial prostheses. Following a historical review of musculoskeletal modeling methods used for estimating knee muscle and contact forces, we describe the first two data sets used for the first two competitions and summarize four subsequent data sets to be used for future competitions. These data sets include tibial contact force, video motion, ground reaction, muscle EMG, muscle strength, static and dynamic imaging, and implant geometry data. Competition participants create musculoskeletal models to predict tibial contact forces without having access to the corresponding in vivo measurements. These blinded predictions provide an unbiased evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of musculoskeletal modeling methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of how these unique data sets can be used by the musculoskeletal modeling research community to improve the estimation of in vivo muscle and contact forces and ultimately to help make musculoskeletal models clinically useful.},

abstract = {The performance of motor tasks requires the coordinated control and continuous adjustment of myriad individual muscles. The basic commands for the successful performance of a sensorimotor task originate in "higher" centers such as the motor cortex, but the actual muscle activation and resulting torques and motion are considerably shaped by the integrative function of the spinal interneurons. The relative contributions of brain and spinal cord are less clear for reaching movements than for automatic tasks such as locomotion. We have modeled a two-axis, four-muscle wrist joint with realistic musculoskeletal mechanics and proprioceptors and a network of regulatory circuitry based on the classical types of spinal interneurons (propriospinal, monosynaptic Ia-excitatory, reciprocal Ia-inhibitory, Renshaw inhibitory, and Ib-inhibitory pathways) and their supraspinal control (via biasing activity, presynaptic inhibition, and fusimotor gain). The modeled system has a very large number of control inputs, not unlike the real spinal cord that the brain must learn to control to produce desired behaviors. It was surprisingly easy to program this model to emulate actual performance in four very different but well described behaviors: (1) stabilizing responses to force perturbations; (2) rapid movement to position target; (3) isometric force to a target level; and (4) adaptation to viscous curl force fields. Our general hypothesis is that, despite its complexity, such regulatory circuitry substantially simplifies the tasks of learning and producing complex movements.},

@article{Shadmehr1992,
abstract = {Feldman (1966) has proposed that a muscle endowed with its spinal reflex system behaves as a non-linear spring with an adjustable resting length. In contrast, because of the length-tension properties of muscles, many researchers have modeled them as non-linear springs with adjustable stiffness. Here we test the merits of each approach: Initially, it is proven that the adjustable stiffness model predicts that isometric muscle force and stiffness are linearly related. We show that this prediction is not supported by data on the static stiffness-force characteristics of reflexive muscles, where stiffness grows non-linearly with force. Therefore, an intact muscle-reflex system does not behave as a non-linear spring with an adjustable stiffness. However, when the same muscle is devoid of its reflexes, the data shows that stiffness grows linearly with force. We aim to understand the functional advantage of the non-linear stiffness-force relationship present in the reflexive muscle. Control of an inverted pendulum with a pair of antagonist muscles is considered. Using an active-state muscle model we describe force development in an areflexive muscle. From the data on the relationship of stiffness and force in the intact muscle we derive the length-tension properties of a reflexive muscle. It is shown that a muscle under the control of its spinal reflexes resembles a non-linear spring with an adjustable resting length. This provides independent evidence in support of the Feldman hypothesis of an adjustable resting length as the control parameter of a reflexive muscle, but it disagrees with his particular formulation. In order to maintain stability of the single joint system, we prove that a necessary condition is that muscle stiffness must grow at least linearly with force at isometric conditions. This shows that co-contraction of antagonist muscles may actually destabilize the limb if the slope of this stiffness-force relationship is less than an amount specified by the change in the moment arm of the muscle as a function of joint configuration. In a reflexive muscle where stiffness grows faster than linearly with force, co-contraction will always lead to an increase in stiffness. Furthermore, with the reflexive muscles, the same level of joint stiffness can be produced by much smaller muscle forces because of the non-linear stiffness-force relationship. This allows the joint to remain stable at a fraction of the metabolic energy cost associated with maintaining stability with areflexive muscles.},

abstract = {Subject-specific finite element models developed from imaging data provide functional representation of anatomical structures and have been used to evaluate healthy and pathologic knee mechanics. The creation of subject-specific models is a time-consuming process when considering manual segmentation and hexahedral (hex) meshing of the articular surfaces to ensure accurate contact assessment. Previous studies have emphasized automated mesh mapping to bone geometry from computed tomography (CT) scans, but have not considered cartilage and soft tissue structures. Statistical shape modeling has been proposed as an alternative approach to develop a population of subject models, but still requires manual segmentation and registration of a training set. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to develop an efficient, integrated mesh-morphing-based segmentation approach to create hex meshes of subject-specific geometries from scan data, to apply the approach to natural femoral, tibial, and patellar cartilage from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and to demonstrate the creation of a statistical shape model of the knee characterizing the modes of variation using principal component analysis. The platform was demonstrated on MR scans from 10 knees and enabled hex mesh generation of the knee articular structures in approximately 1.5 h per subject. In a subset of geometries, average root mean square geometric differences were 0.54 mm for all structures and in quasi-static analyses over a range of flexion angles, differences in predicted peak contact pressures were less than 5.3{\%} between the semi-automated and manually generated models. The integrated segmentation, mesh-morphing approach was employed in the efficient development of subject-specific models and a statistical shape model, where populations of subject-specific models have application to implant design evaluation or surgical planning. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {A neural model of voluntary movement and proprioception is developed that offers an integrated interpretation of the functional roles of diverse cell types in movement-related areas of primate cortex. The model circuit maintains accurate proprioception while controlling voluntary reaches to spatial targets, exertion of force against obstacles, posture maintenance despite perturbations, compliance with an imposed movement, and static and inertial load compensations. Computer simulations show that properties of model elements correspond to the properties of many known cells types in areas 4 and 5. Among these properties are delay period activation, response profiles during movement, kinematic and kinetic sensitivities, and latency of activity onset. In particular, area 4 phasic and tonic cells, respectively, compute velocity and position commands that are capable of activating alpha and gamma motor neurons, thereby shifting the mechanical equilibrium point. Anterior area 5 cells compute the position of the limb using corollary discharges from area 4 and feedback from muscle spindles. Posterior area 5 neurons use the position perception signal and a target position signal to compute a desired movement vector. The cortical loop is closed by a volition-gated projection of this movement vector to the area 4 phasic cells. An auxiliary circuit allows phasic-tonic cells in area 4 to incorporate force command components needed to compensate for static and inertial loads. After reporting simulations of prior experimental results, predictions are made for both motor and parietal cell types under novel experimental protocols.},

Hand motor units are not readily categorized into the classical physiological types as established in the cat gastrocnemius muscle. In addition, the distribution of descending synaptic inputs to motor nuclei supplying different hand muscles is outlined. Motor neurons innervating intrinsic muscles appear to have relatively independent lines of input from supraspinal centres whereas substantial divergence of descending input is seen across motor nuclei supplying extrinsic hand muscles. The functional significance of such differential organizations of descending inputs for the control of hand movements is discussed.},

abstract = {Gait modification is a noninvasive strategy for reducing the external knee adduction torque in patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Recently, a novel "medial thrust" gait pattern characterized by knee medialization during stance phase has been shown to reduce both adduction torque peaks significantly. While changes in footpath (i.e., toe out angle and stance width) also affect the adduction torque peaks, the extent to which footpath changes may alter the effectiveness of medial thrust gait is unknown. This study used a validated patient-specific computational model to investigate this issue. A dynamic optimization framework that accurately predicted adduction torque changes caused by knee medialization or footpath alteration for a specific patient was modified to predict the simultaneous effect of both factors. Medial thrust gait optimizations were then performed for the same patient using imposed footpath alterations consisting of all possible combinations of three toe out angles (nominal +/- 15 degrees) and three stance widths (nominal +/- 50 mm). Overall, predicted adduction torque reductions produced by medial thrust gait were relatively insensitive to footpath alterations. The 32{\%}-34{\%} reduction in both peaks achieved with the nominal footpath was augmented by at most 9{\%} and reduced by at most 3{\%} for the altered footpaths. When combined with knee medialization, footpath alterations would likely have only a secondary effect on knee adduction torque reductions for this particular patient.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the therapeutic effects of different muscle-strengthening exercises on the functional status of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: One hundred thirty-two patients with bilateral knee OA (Altman Grade II) were sequentially divided into 4 random groups (GI to GIV). The patients in group I received isokinetic muscle-strengthening exercise, group II received isotonic muscle-strengthening exercise, group III received isometric muscle-strengthening exercise, and group IV acted as controls. The changes of muscle power of leg flexion and extension were measured with a Kinetic Communicator dynamometer, and patients' functional status was evaluated by visual analogue scale, ambulation speed, and Lequesne index before and after treatment, and at the follow-up 1 year later. Results: The results showed that the patients with OA in each treated group had significant improvement in pain reduction, disability reduction, and in walking speed after treatment and at follow-up when compared with their initial status. Isotonic exercise had the greatest effect on pain reduction after treatment, and fewer participants discontinued the treatment because of exercise knee pain. Isokinetic exercise caused the greatest increase of walking speed and decrease of disability after treatment and at follow-up. The greatest muscle-strength gain in 60°/second angular velocity peak torques was found in the isokinetic and isotonic exercise groups. A significant muscle-strength gain in 180°/second angular velocity peak torques was found only in the isokinetic group after treatment. Conclusion and Relevance: Isotonic exercise is suggested for initial strengthening in patients with OA with exercise knee pain, and isokinetic exercise is suggested for improving joint stability or walking endurance at a: later time. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Todorov2002,
abstract = {A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.},

abstract = {The stiffness that is measured at the hand of a multijoint arm emerges from the combined effects of the elastic properties of the muscles and joints, the geometry of the linkages and muscle attachments, and the neural control circuits that act on the arm. The effective stiffness of a nonlinear linkage such as a two-joint arm depends on the force acting on the system as well as the intrinsic stiffness of the actuators. This paper presents an analysis of the factors that affect limb stiffness, including the effects of external forces. Three potential strategies for controlling the stability of the limb are proposed and demonstrated by computer simulations. The predictions from the simulations are then compared experimentally with measured stiffness values for human subjects working against an external force. These experiments were directed toward understanding what strategies are used by the CNS to control limb stiffness and stability. The experimental evidence showed that human subjects must increase the stiffness at the joints in order to maintain limb stability in the presence of applied external forces at the hand. In the process we identified a precise role for muscles which span two or more joints in the control of over all limb stiffness. A local strategy may be used to achieve limb stability, in which the muscle stiffness increases with muscle force. Multijoint muscles are shown to provide mechanical couplings which are necessary for the maintenance of stability. By utilizing these muscles, the neuro-musculo-skeletal system can control a global property of the system (stability) with a passive local strategy.},

(c) The algorithm is extremely simple, requires no data structures, and handles all degenerate cases. (d) The running time is output sensitive for nondegenerate inputs. (e) The algorithm is easy to parallelize efficiently. For example, the algorithm finds the v vertices of a polyhedron in R(d) defined by a nondegenerate system of n inequalities (or, dually, the v facets of the convex hull of n points in R(d), where each facet contains exactly d given points) in time O(ndv) and O(nd) space. The v vertices in a simple arrangement of n hyperplanes in R(d) can be found in O(n2dv) time and O(nd) space complexity.

abstract = {The ordinary differential equations for musculoskeletal dynamics are often numerically stiff and highly nonlinear. Consequently, simulations require small time steps, and optimal control problems are slow to solve and have poor convergence. In this paper, we present an implicit formulation of musculoskeletal dynamics, which leads to new numerical methods for simulation and optimal control, with the expectation that we can mitigate some of these problems. A first order Rosenbrock method was developed for solving forward dynamic problems using the implicit formulation. It was used to perform real-time dynamic simulation of a complex shoulder arm system with extreme dynamic stiffness. Simulations had an RMS error of only 0.11 degrees in joint angles when running at real-time speed. For optimal control of musculoskeletal systems, a direct collocation method was developed for implicitly formulated models. The method was applied to predict gait with a prosthetic foot and ankle. Solutions were obtained in well under one hour of computation time and demonstrated how patients may adapt their gait to compensate for limitations of a specific prosthetic limb design. The optimal control method was also applied to a state estimation problem in sports biomechanics, where forces during skiing were estimated from noisy and incomplete kinematic data. Using a full musculoskeletal dynamics model for state estimation had the additional advantage that forward dynamic simulations, could be done with the same implicitly formulated model to simulate injuries and perturbation responses. While these methods are powerful and allow solution of previously intractable problems, there are still considerable numerical challenges, especially related to the convergence of gradient-based solvers.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Computer modeling, simulation and optimization are powerful tools that have seen increased use in biomechanics research. Dynamic optimizations can be categorized as either data-tracking or predictive problems. The data-tracking approach has been used extensively to address human movement problems of clinical relevance. The predictive approach also holds great promise, but has seen limited use in clinical applications. Enhanced software tools would facilitate the application of predictive musculoskeletal simulations to clinically-relevant research. The open-source software OpenSim provides tools for generating tracking simulations but not predictive simulations. However, OpenSim includes an extensive application programming interface that permits extending its capabilities with scripting languages such as MATLAB. In the work presented here, we combine the computational tools provided by MATLAB with the musculoskeletal modeling capabilities of OpenSim to create a framework for generating predictive simulations of musculoskeletal movement based on direct collocation optimal control techniques. In many cases, the direct collocation approach can be used to solve optimal control problems considerably faster than traditional shooting methods. Cyclical and discrete movement problems were solved using a simple 1 degree of freedom musculoskeletal model and a model of the human lower limb, respectively. The problems could be solved in reasonable amounts of time (several seconds to 1–2 hours) using the open-source IPOPT solver. The problems could also be solved using the fmincon solver that is included with MATLAB, but the computation times were excessively long for all but the smallest of problems. The performance advantage for IPOPT was derived primarily by exploiting sparsity in the constraints Jacobian. The framework presented here provides a powerful and flexible approach for generating optimal control simulations of musculoskeletal movement using OpenSim and MATLAB. This should allow researchers to more readily use predictive simulation as a tool to address clinical conditions that limit human mobility.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE.Objective: The overall goal of this paper is to demonstrate that dissemination of models and analyses for assessing the reproducibility of simulation results can be incorporated in the scientific review process in biomechanics. Methods: As part of a special issue on model sharing and reproducibility in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, two manuscripts on computational biomechanics were submitted: Rajagopal et al., IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016 and Schmitz and Piovesan, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016. Models used in these studies were shared with the scientific reviewers and the public. In addition to the standard review of the manuscripts, the reviewers downloaded the models and performed simulations that reproduced results reported in the studies. Results: There was general agreement between simulation results of the authors and those of the reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved during the necessary revisions. The manuscripts and instructions for download and simulation were updated in response to the reviewers' feedback; changes that may otherwise have been missed if explicit model sharing and simulation reproducibility analysis was not conducted in the review process. Increased burden on the authors and the reviewers, to facilitate model sharing and to repeat simulations, were noted. Conclusion: When the authors of computational biomechanics studies provide access to models and data, the scientific reviewers can download and thoroughly explore the model, perform simulations, and evaluate simulation reproducibility beyond the traditional manuscript-only review process. Significance: Model sharing and reproducibility analysis in scholarly publishing will result in a more rigorous review process, which will enhance the quality of modeling and simulation studies and inform future users of computational models.},

@article{James2018,
abstract = {To date, realistic models of how the central nervous system governs behaviour have been restricted in scope to the brain, brainstem or spinal column, as if these existed as disembodied organs. Further, the model is often exercised in relation to an in vivo physiological experiment with input comprising an impulse, a periodic signal or constant activation, and output as a pattern of neural activity in one or more neural populations. Any link to behaviour is inferred only indirectly via these activity patterns. We argue that to discover the principles of operation of neural systems, it is necessary to express their behaviour in terms of physical movements of a realistic motor system, and to supply inputs that mimic sensory experience. To do this with confidence, we must connect our brain models to neuro-muscular models and provide relevant visual and proprioceptive feedback signals, thereby closing the loop of the simulation. This paper describes an effort to develop just such an integrated brain and biomechanical system using a number of pre-existing models. It describes a model of the saccadic oculomotor system incorporating a neuromuscular model of the eye and its six extraocular muscles. The position of the eye determines how illumination of a retinotopic input population projects information about the location of a saccade target into the system. A pre-existing saccadic burst generator model was incorporated into the system, which generated motoneuron activity patterns suitable for driving the biomechanical eye. The model was demonstrated to make accurate saccades to a target luminance under a set of environmental constraints. Challenges encountered in the development of this model showed the importance of this integrated modelling approach. Thus, we exposed shortcomings in individual model components which were only apparent when these were supplied with the more plausible inputs available in a closed loop design. Consequently we were able to suggest missing functionality which the system would require to reproduce more realistic behaviour. The construction of such closed-loop animal models constitutes a new paradigm of computational neurobehaviour and promises a more thoroughgoing approach to our understanding of the brain's function as a controller for movement and behaviour.},

abstract = {A Web-based simulation system of the spinal cord circuitry responsible for muscle control is described. The simulator employs two-compartment motoneuron models for S, FR and FF types, with synaptic inputs acting through conductance variations. Four motoneuron pools with their associated interneurons are represented in the simulator, with the possibility of inclusion of more than 2,000 neurons and 2,000,000 synapses. Each motoneuron action potential is followed, after a conduction delay, by a motor unit potential and a motor unit twitch. The sums of all motor unit potentials and twitches result in the electromyogram (EMG), and the muscle force, respectively. Inputs to the motoneuron pool come from populations of interneurons (Ia reciprocal inhibitory interneurons, Ib interneurons, and Renshaw cells) and from stochastic point processes associated with descending tracts. To simulate human electrophysiological experiments, the simulator incorporates external nerve stimulation with orthodromic and antidromic propagation. This provides the mechanisms for reflex generation and activation of spinal neuronal circuits that modulate the activity of another motoneuron pool (e.g., by reciprocal inhibition). The generation of the H-reflex by the Ia-motoneuron pool system and its modulation by spinal cord interneurons is included in the simulation system. Studies with the simulator may include the statistics of individual motoneuron or interneuron spike trains or the collective effect of a motor nucleus on the dynamics of muscle force control. Properties associated with motor-unit recruitment, motor-unit synchronization, recurrent inhibition and reciprocal inhibition may be investigated.},

abstract = {Are fingertip forces produced by subject-independent patterns of muscle excitation? If so, understanding the mechanical basis underlying these muscle coordination strategies would greatly assist surgeons in evaluating options for restoring grasping. With the finger in neutral ad-abduction and flexed 45??at the MCP and PIP, and 10??at DIP joints, eight subjects attempted to produce maximal voluntary forces in four orthogonal directions perpendicular to the distal phalanx (palmar, dorsal, lateral and medial) and in one direction collinear with it (distal). Forces were directed within 4.7 ?? 2.2??(mean ?? S.D.) of target and their magnitudes clustered into three distinct levels (p {\textless} 0.05; post hoc pairwise RMANOVA). Palmar (27.9 ?? 4.1N), distal (24.3 ?? 8.3 N) and medial (22.9 ?? 7.8 N) forces were highest, lateral (14.7 ?? 4.8 N) was intermediate, and dorsal (7.5 ?? 1.5 N) was lowest. Normalized fine-wire EMGs from all seven muscles revealed distinct muscle excitation groups for palmar, dorsal and distal forces (p {\textless} 0.05; post hoc pairwise RMANOVA). Palmar force used flexors, extensors and dorsal interosseous; dorsal force used all muscles; distal force used all muscles except for extensors; medial and lateral forces used all muscles including significant co-excitation of interossei. The excitation strategies predicted to achieve maximal force by a 3-D computer model (four pin joints, inextensible tendons, extensor mechanism and isometric force models for all seven muscles) reproduced the observed use of extensors and absence of palmar interosseous to produce palmar force (to regulate net joint flexion torques), the absence of extensors for distal force, and the use of intrinsics (strong MCP flexors) for dorsal force. The model could not predict the interossei co-excitation seen for medial and lateral forces, which may be a strategy to prevent MCP joint damage. The model predicts distal force to be most sensitive to dorsal interosseous strength, and palmar and distal forces to be very sensitive to MCP and PIP flexor moment arms, and dorsal force to be sensitive to the moment arm of and the tension allocation to the PIP extensor tendon of the extensor mechanism.},

abstract = {How should robotic or prosthetic arms be programmed to move? Copying human smooth movements is popular in synthetic systems, but what does this really achieve? We cannot address these biomimetic issues without a deep understanding of why natural movements are so stereotyped. In this article, we distinguish between 'functional' and 'aesthetic' biomimetics. Functional biomimetics requires insight into the problem that nature has solved and recognition that a similar problem exists in the synthetic system. In aesthetic biomimetics, nature is copied for its own sake and no insight is needed. We examine the popular minimum jerk (MJ) model that has often been used to generate smooth human-like point-to-point movements in synthetic arms. The MJ model was originally justified as maximizing 'smoothness'; however, it is also the limiting optimal trajectory for a wide range of cost functions for brief movements, including the minimum variance (MV) model, where smoothness is a by-product of optimizing the speed–accuracy trade-off imposed by proportional noise (PN: signal-dependent noise with the standard deviation proportional to mean). PN is unlikely to be dominant in synthetic systems, and the control objectives of natural movements (speed and accuracy) would not be optimized in synthetic systems by human-like movements. Thus, employing MJ or MV controllers in robotic arms is just aesthetic biomimetics. For prosthetic arms, the goal is aesthetic by definition, but it is still crucial to recognize that MV trajectories and PN are deeply embedded in the human motor system. Thus, PN arises at the neural level, as a recruitment strategy of motor units and probably optimizes motor neuron noise. Human reaching is under continuous adaptive control. For prosthetic devices that do not have this natural architecture, natural plasticity would drive the system towards unnatural movements. We propose that a truly neuromorphic system with parallel force generators (muscle fibres) and noisy drivers (motor neurons) would permit plasticity to adapt the control of a prosthetic limb towards human-like movement.},

The goal of this study was to develop a discrete element model of the knee that is open source to allow for utilization of modeling by a wider audience of re- searchers. Methods: A six degree-of-freedom tibiofemoral and one degree-of-freedom patellofemoral joint were created in OpenSim. Eighteen ligament bundles and tibiofemoral contact were included in the model. Results: During a passive flexion movement, maxi- mum deviation of the model from the literature occurred at the most flexed angle with deviations of 2° adduction, 7° internal rota- tion, 1-mm posterior translation, 12-mm inferior translation, and 4-mm lateral translation. Similarly, the overall elongation of the ligaments agreed with literature values with strains of less than 13{\%}. Conclusion: These results provide validation of the physio- logical relevance of the model. Significance: This model is one of the few open source, discrete element kneemodels to date, and has many potential applications, one being for use in an open-source cosimulation framework.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of the finger extensor mechanism on the bone-to-bone contact forces at the interphalangeal and metacarpal joints and also on the forces in the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles during finger pressing. This was done with finger postures ranging from very flexed to fully extended. The role of the finger extensor mechanism was investigated by using two alternative finger models, one which omitted the extensor mechanism and another which included it. A six-camera three-dimensional motion analysis system was used to capture the finger posture during maximum voluntary isometric pressing. The fingertip loads were recorded simultaneously using a force plate system. Two three-dimensional biomechanical finger models, a minimal model without extensor mechanism and a full model with extensor mechanism (tendon network), were used to calculate the joint bone-to-bone contact forces and the extrinsic and intrinsic muscle forces. If the full model is assumed to be realistic, then the results suggest some useful biomechanical advantages provided by the tendon network of the extensor mechanism. It was found that the forces in the intrinsic muscles (interosseus group and lumbrical) are significantly reduced by 22{\%} to 61{\%} due to the action of the extensor mechanism, with the greatest reductions in more flexed postures. The bone-to-bone contact force at the MCP joint is reduced by 10{\%} to 41{\%}. This suggests that the extensor mechanism may help to reduce the risk of injury at the finger joints and also to moderate the forces in intrinsic muscles. These apparent biomechanical advantages may be a result of the extensor mechanism's distinctive interconnected fibrous structure, through which the contraction of the intrinsic muscles as flexors of the MCP joint can generate extensions at the DIP and PIP joints.},

Subject-specific geometries and kinematic data, acquired from the same living subject, were the foundations of the 3D quasi-static knee model developed. Each cruciate ligament was modelled by means of 25 elastic springs, paying attention to the anatomical twisting of the fibres. The sensitivity of the model to the cross-sectional area was performed during the anterior/posterior tibial translations, the sensitivity to all the cruciate ligaments parameters was performed during the internal/external rotations. The model reproduced very well the mechanical behaviour reported in literature during anterior/posterior translations, in particular considering 30{\%} of the mean insertional area. During the internal/external tibial rotations, similar behaviour of the axial torques was obtained in the three sensitivity analyses. The overlapping of the ligaments was assessed at about 25 degrees of internal axial rotation. The presented model featured a good level of accuracy in combination with a low computational weight, and it could provide an in vivo estimation of the role of the cruciate ligaments during the execution of daily living activities.},

abstract = {The amygdala has long been implicated in the mediation of emotional and social behaviors. Because there are very few human subjects with selective bilateral damage of the amygdala, much of the evidence for these functional associations has come from studies employing animal subjects. Macaque monkeys live in complex, highly organized social groups that are characterized by stable and hierarchical relationships among individuals who engage in complex forms of social communication, such as facial expressions. Understanding the role of the amygdala in animals that display a level of social sophistication approaching that of humans will help in understanding the amygdala's role in human social behavior and in psychopathology such as social anxiety. Selective bilateral lesions of the amygdala in mature macaque monkeys result in a lack of fear responses to inanimate objects and a "socially uninhibited" pattern of behavior. These results imply that the amygdala functions as a protective "brake" on engagement of objects or organisms while an evaluation of potential threat is carried out. They also suggest that social anxiety may be a dysregulation or hyperactivity of the amygdala's evaluative process. Finally, recent data from developmental studies raise the possibility that, at least at some developmental stages, fear in social contexts may be subserved by different brain regions than fear of inanimate objects.},

abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are commonly incurred by recreational and professional women athletes during non-contact jumping maneuvers in sports like basketball and volleyball, where incidences of ACL injury is more frequent to females compared to males. What remains a numerical challenge is in vivo calculation of ACL strain and internal force. This study investigated effects of increasing stop-jump height on neuromuscular and bio-mechanical properties of knee and ACL, when performed by young female recreational athletes. The underlying hypothesis is increasing stop-jump (platform) height increases knee valgus angles and external moments which also increases ACL strain and internal force. Using numerical analysis tools comprised of Inverse Kinematics, Computed Muscle Control and Forward Dynamics, a novel approach is presented for computing ACL strain and internal force based on (1) knee joint kinematics and (2) optimization of muscle activation, with ACL insertion into musculoskeletal model. Results showed increases in knee valgus external moments and angles with increasing stop-jump height. Increase in stop-jump height from 30 to 50 cm lead to increase in average peak valgus external moment from 40.5 ± 3.2 to 43.2 ± 3.7 Nm which was co-incidental with increase in average peak ACL strain, from 9.3 ± 3.1 to 13.7 ± 1.1{\%}, and average peak ACL internal force, from 1056.1 ± 71.4 to 1165.4 ± 123.8 N for the right side with comparable increases in the left. In effect this study demonstrates a technique for estimating dynamic changes to knee and ACL variables by conducting musculoskeletal simulation on motion analysis data, collected from actual stop-jump tasks performed by young recreational women athletes.},

abstract = {This paper describes a neuro-musculo-skeletal model of the human lower body which has been developed with the aim of studying the effects of spinal cord injury on locomotor abilities. The model represents spinal neural control modules corresponding to central pattern generators, muscle spindle based reflex pathways, golgi tendon organ based pathways and cutaneous reflex pathways, which are coupled to the lower body musculo-skeletal dynamics. As compared to other neuro-musculo-skeletal models which aim to provide a description of the possible mechanisms involved in the production of locomotion, the goal of the model here is to understand the role of the known spinal pathways in locomotion. Thus, while other models focus primarily on functionality at the overall system level, the model here emphasizes functional and topological correspondance with the biological system at the level of the subcomponents representing spinal pathways. Such a model is more suitable for the detailed investigation of clinical questions related to spinal control of locomotion. The model is used here to perform preliminary experiments addressing the following issues: (1) the significance of spinal reflex modalities for walking and (2) the relative criticality of the various reflex modalities. The results of these experiments shed new light on the possible role of the reflex modalities in the regulation of stance and walking speed. The results also demonstrate the use of the model for the generation of hypothesis which could guide clinical experimentation.

It included subjects in biology, energy, robotics, and information technology. On the subject of robotics, it reports: “Robots have the potential to replace humans in a variety of applications with far-reaching implications. [...]. The development and implementation of robots for elder-care applications, and the development of human-augmentation technologies, mean that robots could be working alongside humans in looking after and rehabilitating people”. In this spirit, we explore here a methodology to enable greater maneuverability and interactivity of robots in human environments (Figure 2.1). As the expectation of humanoid robots to operate as human helpers and social companions grows, the need to improve their motor skills becomes increasingly important. Equipped with highly dexterous anthropomorphic systems, sensors for environmental awareness, and powerful computers, humanoids should be capable of handling many basic chores that humans do. Yet they cannot, not to the level that would make them practical.},

abstract = {The graphics processing unit (GPU) has made significant strides as an accelerator in parallel computing. However, because the GPU has resided out on PCIe as a discrete device, the performance of GPU applications can be bottlenecked by data transfers between the CPU and GPU over PCIe. Emerging heterogeneous computing architectures that "fuse" the functionality of the CPU and GPU, e.g., AMD Fusion and Intel Knights Ferry, hold the promise of addressing the PCIe bottleneck. In this paper, we empirically characterize and analyze the efficacy of AMD Fusion, an architecture that combines general-purposex86 cores and programmable accelerator cores on the same silicon die. We characterize its performance via a set of micro-benchmarks (e.g., PCIe data transfer), kernel benchmarks(e.g., reduction), and actual applications (e.g., molecular dynamics). Depending on the benchmark, our results show that Fusion produces a 1.7 to 6.0-fold improvement in the data-transfer time, when compared to a discrete GPU. In turn, this improvement in data-transfer performance can significantly enhance application performance. For example, running a reduction benchmark on AMD Fusion with its mere 80 GPU cores improves performance by 3.5-fold over the discrete AMD Radeon HD 5870 GPU with its 1600 more powerful GPU cores.},

To understand human levels of dexterity and to achieve it with robotic hands, we constructed an anatomically correct testbed (ACT) hand which allows for the investigation of the biomechanical features and neural control strategies of the human hand. This paper focuses on developing control strategies for the index finger motion of the ACT Hand. A direct muscle position control and a force-optimized joint control are implemented as building blocks and tools for comparisons with future biological control approaches. We show how Gaussian process regression techniques can be used to determine the relationships between the muscle and joint motions in both controllers. Our experiments demonstrate that the direct muscle position controller allows for accurate and fast position tracking, while the force-optimized joint controller allows for exploitation of actuation redundancy in the finger critical for this redundant system. Furthermore, a comparison between Gaussian processes and least squares regression method shows that Gaussian processes provide better parameter estimation and tracking performance. This first control investigation on the ACT hand opens doors to implement biological strategies observed in humans and achieve the ultimate human-level dexterity.},

abstract = {The electrical membrane properties of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) neurons and their postsynaptic responses to stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STH) were studied in an in vitro slice preparation. SNR neurons were divided into two types based on their electrical membrane properties. Type-I neurons possessed (1) spontaneous repetitive firings, (2) short-duration action potentials, (3) less prominent spike accommodations, and (4) a strong delayed rectification during membrane depolarization. Type-II neurons had (1) no spontaneous firings, (2) long-duration action potentials, (3) a prominent spike accommodation, (4) a relatively large post-active hyperpolarization, and (5) a less prominent delayed rectification. These membrane properties were very similar to those observed in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) neurons in slice preparations. Features commoon to both types of neurons include that (1) the input resistance was similar, (2) they showed an anomalous rectification during strong hyperpolarizations, and (3) they were capable of generating Ca potentials. Intracellular responses of both types of SNR neurons to STH stimulation consisted of initial short-duration monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and a short-duration inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) followed by a long-duration depolarization. The IPSP was markedly suppressed by application of bicuculline methiodide and the polarity was reversed by intracellular injection of Cl−. In the preparations obtained from internal capsule-transected rats. STH-induced EPSPs had much longer durations than those observed in the normal preparations, while the amplitude of IPSPs and succeeding small-amplitude long-duration depolarizations was small. The results indicated that SNR contains two electrophysiologically different types of neurons, and that both types of neurons receive monosynaptic EPSPs from STh and IPSPs from areas rostral to STH.},

abstract = {In analyses of the motor system, two hierarchies are often posited: The first—the action hierarchy—is a decomposition of an action into subactions and sub-subactions. The second—the control hierarchy—is a postulated hierarchy in the neural control processes that are supposed to bring about the action. A general assumption in cognitive neuroscience is that these two hierarchies are internally consistent and provide complementary descriptions of neuronal control processes. In this article, we suggest that neither offers a complete explanation and that they cannot be reconciled in a logical or conceptually coherent way. Furthermore, neither pays proper attention to the dynamics and temporal aspects of neural control processes. We will explore an alternative hierarchical organization in which causality is inherent in the dynamics over time. Specifically, high levels of the hierarchy encode more stable (goal-related) representations, whereas lower levels represent more transient (actions and motor acts) kinematics. If employed properly, a hierarchy based on this latter principle of temporal extension is not subject to the problems that plague the traditional accounts.},

abstract = {We describe several influential hypotheses in the field of motor control including the equilibrium-point (referent configuration) hypothesis, the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis, and the idea of synergies based on the principle of motor abundance. The equilibrium-point hypothesis is based on the idea of control with thresholds for activation of neuronal pools; it provides a framework for analysis of both voluntary and involuntary movements. In particular, control of a single muscle can be adequately described with changes in the threshold of motor unit recruitment during slow muscle stretch (threshold of the tonic stretch reflex). Unlike the ideas of internal models, the equilibrium-point hypothesis does not assume neural computations of mechanical variables. The uncontrolled manifold hypothesis is based on the dynamic system approach to movements; it offers a toolbox to analyze synergic changes within redundant sets of elements related to stabilization of potentially important performance variables. The referent configuration hypothesis and the principle of abundance can be naturally combined into a single coherent scheme of control of multi-element systems. A body of experimental data on healthy persons and patients with movement disorders are reviewed in support of the mentioned hypotheses. In particular, movement disorders associated with spasticity are considered as consequences of an impaired ability to shift threshold of the tonic stretch reflex within the whole normal range. Technical details and applications of the mentioned hypo-theses to studies of motor learning are described. We view the mentioned hypotheses as the most promising ones in the field of motor control, based on a solid physical and neurophysiological foundation.},

abstract = {Dynamic patient-specific musculoskeletal models have great potential for addressing clinical problems in orthopedics and rehabilitation. However, their predictive capability is limited by how well the underlying kinematic model matches the patient's structure. This study presents a general two-level optimization procedure for tuning any multi-joint kinematic model to a patient's experimental movement data. An outer level optimization modifies the model's parameters (joint position and orientations) while repeated inner level optimizations modify the model's degrees of freedom given the current parameters, with the goal of minimizing errors between model and experimental marker trajectories. The approach is demonstrated by fitting a 27 parameter, three-dimensional, 12 degree-of-freedom lower-extremity kinematic model to synthetic and experimental movement data for isolated joint (hip, knee, and ankle) and gait (full leg) motions. For noiseless synthetic data, the approach successfully recovered the known joint parameters to within an arbitrarily tight tolerance. When noise was added to the synthetic data, root-mean-square (RMS) errors between known and recovered joint parameters were within 10.4??and 10mm. For experimental data, RMS marker distance errors were reduced by up to 62{\%} compared to methods that estimate joint parameters from anatomical landmarks. Optimized joint parameters found using a loaded full-leg gait motion differed significantly from those found using unloaded individual joint motions. In the future, this approach may facilitate the creation of dynamic patient-specific musculoskeletal models for predictive clinical applications. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity in the FEF of monkeys performing memory-guided saccade and covert visual search tasks. We compared visual latencies and the time course of spatially selective responses in LFPs and spiking activity. Consistent with the view that LFPs represent synaptic input, visual responses appeared first in the LFPs followed by visual responses in the spiking activity. However, spatially selective activity identifying the location of the target in the visual search array appeared in the spikes about 30 ms before it appeared in the LFPs. Because LFPs reflect dendritic input and spikes measure neuronal output in a local brain region, this temporal relationship suggests that spatial selection necessary for attention and eye movements is computed locally in FEF from spatially nonselective inputs.},

abstract = {Simulation-based medicine and the development of complex computer models of biological structures is becoming ubiquitous for advancing biomedical engineering and clinical research. Finite element analysis (FEA) has been widely used in the last few decades to understand and predict biomechanical phenomena. Modeling and simulation approaches in biomechanics are highly interdisciplinary, involving novice and skilled developers in all areas of biomedical engineering and biology. While recent advances in model development and simulation platforms offer a wide range of tools to investigators, the decision making process during modeling and simulation has become more opaque. Hence, reliability of such models used for medical decision making and for driving multiscale analysis comes into question. Establishing guidelines for model development and dissemination is a daunting task, particularly with the complex and convoluted models used in FEA. Nonetheless, if better reporting can be established, researchers will have a better understanding of a model's value and the potential for reusability through sharing will be bolstered. Thus, the goal of this document is to identify resources and considerate reporting parameters for FEA studies in biomechanics. These entail various levels of reporting parameters for model identification, model structure, simulation structure, verification, validation, and availability. While we recognize that it may not be possible to provide and detail all of the reporting considerations presented, it is possible to establish a level of confidence with selective use of these parameters. More detailed reporting, however, can establish an explicit outline of the decision-making process in simulation-based analysis for enhanced reproducibility, reusability, and sharing. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Muscle coordination studies repeatedly show low-dimensionality of muscle activations for a wide variety of motor tasks. The basis vectors of this low-dimensional subspace, termed muscle synergies, are hypothesized to reflect neurally-established functional muscle groupings that simplify body control. However, the muscle synergy hypothesis has been notoriously difficult to prove or falsify. We use cadaveric experiments and computational models to perform a crucial thought experiment and develop an alternative explanation of how muscle synergies could be observed without the nervous system having controlled muscles in groups. We first show that the biomechanics of the limb constrains musculotendon length changes to a low-dimensional subspace across all possible movement directions. We then show that a modest assumption--that each muscle is independently instructed to resist length change--leads to the result that electromyographic (EMG) synergies will arise without the need to conclude that they are a product of neural coupling among muscles. Finally, we show that there are dimensionality-reducing constraints in the isometric production of force in a variety of directions, but that these constraints are more easily controlled for, suggesting new experimental directions. These counter-examples to current thinking clearly show how experimenters could adequately control for the constraints described here when designing experiments to test for muscle synergies--but, to the best of our knowledge, this has not yet been done.},

By using the tendon as a force transmission mechanism, compact design of the robot hand is achieved with the developed controller. Problems specific to the tendon characteristics are considered, such as the slacking problem of tendons when the joint is disturbed, and the tendon elongation problem when the collocated position sensing method is used for compact design. To cope with these problems, two fundamental algorithms are developed and implemented on a laboratory apparatus, the POSTECH Hand II. First, a position estimation algorithm is developed to evaluate the accurate position of the hand, leading to an antagonistic tendon controller. Secondly, an active stiffness control algorithm is developed to control the fingertip force. It is shown that the finger produces excellent linear stiffness characteristics which justifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The object stiffness control is also implemented to exert desired force to the environment when the hand grasps an object, and is evaluated via experiments.},

abstract = {An important question in motor neuroscience is how the nervous system controls the spatiotemporal activation patterns of redundant muscles in generating accurate movements. The redundant muscles may not only underlie the flexibility of our movements but also pose the challenging problem of how to select a specific sequence of muscle activation from the huge number of possible activations. Here, we propose that noise in the motor command that has an influence on task achievement should be considered in determining the optimal motor commands over redundant muscles. We propose an optimal control model for step-tracking wrist movements with redundant muscles that minimizes the end-point variance under signal-dependent noise. Step-tracking wrist movements of human and nonhuman primates provide a detailed data set to investigate the control mechanisms in movements with redundant muscles. The experimental EMG data can be summarized by two eminent features: 1) amplitude-graded EMG pattern, where the timing of the activity of the agonist and antagonist bursts show slight variations with changes in movement directions, and only the amplitude of activity is modulated; and 2) cosine tuning for movement directions exhibited by the agonist and antagonist bursts, and the discrepancy found between a muscle's agonist preferred direction and its pulling direction. In addition, it is also an important observation that subjects often overshoot the target. We demonstrate that the proposed model captures not only the spatiotemporal activation patterns of wrist muscles but also trajectory overshooting. This suggests that when recruiting redundant muscles, the nervous system may optimize the motor commands across the muscles to reduce the negative effects of motor noise.},

abstract = {Simulating and analysing eye movement is useful for assessing visual system contribution to discomfort with respect to body movements, especially in virtual environments where simulation sickness might occur. It can also be used in the design of eye prosthesis or humanoid robot eye. In this paper, we present two biomechanic ocular models that are easily integrated into the available musculoskeletal models. The model was previously used to simulate eye-head coordination. The models are used to simulate and analyse eye movements. The proposed models are based on physiological and kinematic properties of the human eye. They incorporate an eye-globe, orbital suspension tissues and six muscles with their connective tissues (pulleys). Pulleys were incorporated in rectus and inferior oblique muscles. The two proposed models are the passive pulleys and the active pulleys models. Dynamic simulations of different eye movements, including fixation, saccade and smooth pursuit, are performed to validate both models. The resultant force-length curves of the models were similar to the experimental data. The simulation results show that the proposed models are suitable to generate eye movement simulations with results comparable to other musculoskeletal models. The maximum kinematic root mean square error (RMSE) is 5.68° and 4.35° for the passive and active pulley models, respectively. The analysis of the muscle forces showed realistic muscle activation with increased muscle synergy in the active pulley model.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations play an important role in solving complex engineering problems and have the potential to revolutionize medical decision making and treatment strategies. In this paper, we combine the rapid model-based design, control systems and powerful numerical method strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with the simulation and human movement dynamics strengths of OpenSim by developing a new interface between the two software tools. OpenSim is integrated with Simulink using the MATLAB S-function mechanism, and the interface is demonstrated using both open-loop and closed-loop control systems. While the open-loop system uses MATLAB/Simulink to separately reproduce the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool, the closed-loop system adds the unique feature of feedback control to OpenSim, which is necessary for most human movement simulations. An arm model example was successfully used in both open-loop and closed-loop cases. For the open-loop case, the simulation reproduced results from the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool with root mean square (RMS) differences of 0.03° for the shoulder elevation angle and 0.06° for the elbow flexion angle. MATLAB's variable step-size integrator reduced the time required to generate the forward dynamic simulation from 7.1. s (OpenSim) to 2.9. s (MATLAB). For the closed-loop case, a proportional-integral-derivative controller was used to successfully balance a pole on model's hand despite random force disturbances on the pole. The new interface presented here not only integrates the OpenSim and MATLAB/Simulink software tools, but also will allow neuroscientists, physiologists, biomechanists, and physical therapists to adapt and generate new solutions as treatments for musculoskeletal conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Planar musculoskeletal models are common in the inverse dynamics analysis of human movements such as walking, running and jumping. The continued interest in such models is justified by their simplicity and computational efficiency. Related to a human planar model, a unified formulation for both the flying and support phases of the sagittal plane movements is developed. The actuation involves muscle forces in the lower limbs and the resultant muscle torques in the other body joints. The dynamic equations, introduced in absolute coordinates of the segments, are converted into useful compact forms using the projective technique. The solution to a determinate inverse dynamics problem allows for the explicit determination of the external reactions (presumed to vanish during the flying phases) and the resultant muscle torques in all the model joints. The indeterminate inverse dynamics problem is then focused on the assessment of muscle forces and joint reaction forces selectively in the supporting lower limb. Numerical results of the inverse dynamics simulation of sample sagittal plane movements are reported to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the improved formulation.},

The reflex loops include the spindle organ, Golgi tendon organ, and Renshaw cell. Their effects are investigated quantitatively in detail. A two-muscle (agonist/antagonist) system with interaction is further studied. Moreover, a model in combination with the central oscillation and peripheral system is developed.

The accuracy of the muscle, bone, and tendon geometry as well as the accuracy of muscle and tendon dynamic deformation are of paramount importance in all these applications. We present a framework for extracting and simulating high resolution musculoskeletal geometry from the segmented visible human data set. We simulate 30 contact/collision coupled muscles in the upper limb and describe a computationally tractable implementation using an embedded mesh framework. Muscle geometry is embedded in a nonmanifold, connectivity preserving simulation mesh molded out of a lower resolution BCC lattice containing identical, well-shaped elements, leading to a relaxed time step restriction for stability and, thus, reduced computational cost. The muscles are endowed with a transversely isotropic, quasiincompressible constitutive model that incorporates muscle fiber fields as well as passive and active components. The simulation takes advantage of a new robust finite element technique that handles both degenerate and inverted tetrahedra.},

abstract = {The operational space formulation (Khatib, 1987), applied to rigid-body manipulators, describes how to decouple task-space and null-space dynamics, and write control equations that correspond only to forces at the end-effector or, alternatively, only to motion within the null-space. We would like to apply this useful theory to modern humanoids and other legged systems, for manipulation or similar tasks, however these systems present additional challenges due to their underactuated floating bases and contact states that can dynamically change. In recent work, Sentis et al. derived controllers for such systems by implementing a task Jacobian projected into a space consistent with the supporting constraints and underactuation (the so called "support consistent reduced Jacobian"). Here, we take a new approach to derive operational space controllers for constrained underactuated systems, by first considering the operational space dynamics within "projected inverse-dynamics" (Aghili, 2005), and subsequently resolving underactuation through the addition of dynamically consistent control torques. Doing so results in a simplified control solution compared with previous results, and importantly yields several new insights into the underlying problem of operational space control in constrained environments: 1) Underactuated systems, such as humanoid robots, cannot in general completely decouple task and null-space dynamics. However, 2) there may exist an infinite number of control solutions to realize desired task-space dynamics, and 3) these solutions involve the addition of dynamically consistent null-space motion or constraint forces (or combinations of both). In light of these findings, we present several possible control solutions, with varying optimization criteria, and highlight some of their practical consequences.},

A review of the existing 3D models of the fingers is presented, and an alternative one is proposed. The validity of the model has been proved by means of two simulations: free flexion-extension motion of all joints, and free metacarpophalangeal (MCP) adduction motion. The simulation shows the need for a dynamic model including inertial effects when studying fast movements and the relevance of modelling passive forces generated by the structures studying free movements, such as the force exerted by the muscles when they are stretched and the passive action of the ligaments over the MCP joint in order to reproduce the muscular force pattern during the simulation of the free MCP abduction-adduction movements.},

In these experiments participants were asked to make rapid reach movements toward a target in an odd-color search task, i.e., reaching for a green square among red squares and vice versa (e.g., Song and Nakayama, 2008). Interestingly these studies found that in a high number of trials movements were initially directed toward a distractor and only later were adjusted toward the target. These "curved" trajectories occurred particularly frequently when the target in the directly preceding trial had a different color (priming effect). Our model is embedded in a closed-loop control of a LEGO robot arm aiming to mimic these reach movements. The model is based on our earlier work which suggests that target selection in visual search is implemented through parallel interactions between competitive and cooperative processes in the brain (Heinke and Humphreys, 2003; Heinke and Backhaus, 2011). To link this model with the control of the robot arm we implemented a topological representation of movement parameters following the dynamic field theory (Erlhagen and Schoener, 2002). The robot arm is able to mimic the results of the odd-color search task including the priming effect and also generates human-like trajectories with a bell-shaped velocity profile. Theoretical implications and predictions are discussed in the paper.},

Various accounts have attributed this latency reduction (referred to as thegap effect) to facilitated sensory processing, oculomotor readiness, or attentional processes. Two experiments were performed to explore the relative contributions of these factors to the gap effect. Experiment 1 demonstrates that the reduction in saccadic reaction time (RT) produced by fixation point offset is additive with the effect of target luminance. Experiment 2 indicates that the gap effect is specific for saccades directed toward a peripheral target and does not influence saccades directed away from the target (i.e., antisaccades) or choice-manual RT. The results are consistent with an interpretation of the gap effect in terms of facilitated premotor processing in the superior colliculus.},

Through a computational model of these interactions we show that, under the influence of appropriate external input, the two nuclei can be switched between states of high and low activity or can generate oscillations consisting of bursts of high-frequency activity repeated at a low rate. It is further demonstrated from the model that the generation of the repetitive bursting behaviour is favoured by increased inhibition of the GP, which is a condition indicated in Parkinson's disease. Paradoxically, increased striatal inhibition of the GP is predicted to cause an increase rather than a decrease in its mean firing rate. These behaviours, arising from a biologically inspired computational model of the STN-GP interaction, have important consequences for basal ganglia function and dysfunction.},

abstract = {Combined efforts in the fields of neuroscience, computer science, and biology allowed to design biologically realistic models of the brain based on spiking neural networks. For a proper validation of these models, an embodiment in a dynamic and rich sensory environment, where the model is exposed to a realistic sensory-motor task, is needed. Due to the complexity of these brain models that, at the current stage, cannot deal with real-time constraints, it is not possible to embed them into a real-world task. Rather, the embodiment has to be simulated as well. While adequate tools exist to simulate either complex neural networks or robots and their environments, there is so far no tool that allows to easily establish a communication between brain and body models. The Neurorobotics Platform is a new web-based environment that aims to fill this gap by offering scientists and technology developers a software infrastructure allowing them to connect brain models to detailed simulations of robot bodies and environments and to use the resulting neurorobotic systems for in silico experimentation. In order to simplify the workflow and reduce the level of the required programming skills, the platform provides editors for the specification of experimental sequences and conditions, environments, robots, and brain-body connectors. In addition to that, a variety of existing robots and environments are provided. This work presents the architecture of the first release of the Neurorobotics Platform developed in subproject 10 "Neurorobotics" of the Human Brain Project (HBP). At the current state, the Neurorobotics Platform allows researchers to design and run basic experiments in neurorobotics using simulated robots and simulated environments linked to simplified versions of brain models. We illustrate the capabilities of the platform with three example experiments: a Braitenberg task implemented on a mobile robot, a sensory-motor learning task based on a robotic controller, and a visual tracking embedding a retina model on the iCub humanoid robot. These use-cases allow to assess the applicability of the Neurorobotics Platform for robotic tasks as well as in neuroscientific experiments.},

abstract = {The study objective was to investigate the influence of coronal plane alignment and ligament properties on total knee replacement (TKR) contact loads during walking. We created a subject-specific knee model of an 83-year-old male who had an instrumented TKR. The knee model was incorporated into a lower extremity musculoskeletal model and included deformable contact, ligamentous structures, and six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. A novel numerical optimization technique was used to simultaneously predict muscle forces, secondary knee kinematics, ligament forces, and joint contact pressures from standard gait analysis data collected on the subject. The nominal knee model predictions of medial, lateral, and total contact forces during gait agreed well with TKR measures, with root-mean-square (rms) errors of 0.23, 0.22, and 0.33 body weight (BW), respectively. Coronal plane component alignment did not affect total knee contact loads, but did alter the medial-lateral load distribution, with 4 deg varus and 4 deg valgus rotations in component alignment inducing +17{\%} and -23{\%} changes in the first peak medial tibiofemoral contact forces, respectively. A Monte Carlo analysis showed that uncertainties in ligament stiffness and reference strains induce ±0.2 BW uncertainty in tibiofemoral force estimates over the gait cycle. Ligament properties had substantial influence on the TKR load distributions, with the medial collateral ligament and iliotibial band (ITB) properties having the largest effects on medial and lateral compartment loading, respectively. The computational framework provides a viable approach for virtually designing TKR components, considering parametric uncertainty and predicting the effects of joint alignment and soft tissue balancing procedures on TKR function during movement.},

abstract = {The bicycle, a simple toy to many, turns out to be an excellent platform to study the intricacies of vehicle dynamics, human-machine interaction, and human operator control for both academic and economical reasons. The bicycle is inherently unstable at low speeds and the human generally actuates the non-minimum phase system, and thus balances, only by means of rotating the handlebars. This dissertation describes a multi-year multi-person effort to better understand the dynamics of the bicycle, the biomechanics of the rider, and the rider's internal control system through theory and extensive experimentation. The chapters herein focus on the development of open loop bicycle models, some of which include the rider's biomechanics, the resulting predicted motion and model characteristics, the accurate measurement and estimation of both the bicycle and rider's physical parameters, observation of a rider's control motions, the development of experimental bicycles capable of measuring kinematics and forces, control theory including that of the human operator, and finally the identification of the both the plant and controller of the bicycle-rider system. The work has revealed a number of interesting conclusions including the primary biomechanic actuators used by the human in control, effects of the rider's motion and constraints on bicycle stability, the inadequacy of the Whipple bicycle model, and the ability of a simple multi-output control system based on the classical crossover model to describe the human's control efforts while being externally perturbed. These findings have implications in both single track vehicle design and human-machine interaction theory. Future applications may be able to utilize the methods and results to help objectively design bicycles with improved handling, stability, and controllability whereas human operator research may be able to build on the validated crossover model theory of manual control.},

In contrast to previous approaches, the problem of computing contact forces is not transformed into an optimization problem. Because of this, the need for sophisticated optimization software packages is eliminated. For both systems with and without friction, the algorithm has proven to be considerably faster, simpler, and more reliable than previous approaches to the problem. In particular, implementation of the algorithm by nonspecialists in numerical programming is quite fea- sible.},

abstract = {We present a biologically plausible model of processing intrinsic to the basal ganglia based on the computational premise that action selection is a primary role of these central brain structures. By encoding the propensity for selecting a given action in a scalar value (the salience), it is shown that action selection may be recast in terms of signal selection. The generic properties of signal selection are defined and neural networks for this type of computation examined. A comparison between these networks and basal ganglia anatomy leads to a novel functional decomposition of the basal ganglia architecture into 'selection' and 'control' pathways. The former pathway performs the selection per se via a feedforward off-centre on-surround network. The control pathway regulates the action of the selection pathway to ensure its effective operation, and synergistically complements its dopaminergic modulation. The model contrasts with the prevailing functional segregation of basal ganglia into 'direct' and 'indirect' pathways.},

abstract = { This paper presents the enhanced stiffness modeling and analysis of robot manipulators, and a methodology for their stiffness identification and characterization. Assuming that the manipulator links are infinitely stiff, the enhanced stiffness model contains: 1) the passive and active stiffness of the joints and 2) the active stiffness created by the change in the manipulator configuration, and by external force vector acting upon the manipulator end point. The stiffness formulation not accounting for the latter is known as conventional stiffness formulation, which is obviously not complete and is valid only when: 1) the manipulator is in an unloaded quasistatic configuration and 2) the manipulator Jacobian matrix is constant throughout the workspace. The experimental system considered in this study is a Motoman SK 120 robot manipulator with a closed-chain mechanism. While the deflection of the manipulator end point under a range of external forces is provided by a high precision laser measurement system, a wrist force/torque sensor measures the external forces. Based on the experimental data and the enhanced stiffness model, the joint stiffness values are first identified. These stiffness values are then used to prove that conventional stiffness modeling is incomplete. Finally, they are employed to characterize stiffness properties of the robot manipulator. It has been found that although the component of the stiffness matrix differentiating the enhanced stiffness model from the conventional one is not always positive definite, the resulting stiffness matrix can still be positive definite. This follows that stability of the stiffness matrix is not influenced by this stiffness component. This study contributes to the previously reported work from the point of view of using the enhanced stiffness model for stiffness identification, verification and characterization, and of new experimental results proving that the conventional stiffness matrix is not complete and is valid under certain assumptions.},

abstract = {Subject-specific and generic musculoskeletal models are the computational instantiation of hypotheses, and stochastic techniques help explore their validity. We present two such examples to explore the hypothesis of muscle redundancy. The first addresses the effect of anatomical variability on static force capabilities for three individual cat hindlimbs, each with seven kinematic degrees of freedom (DoFs) and 31 muscles. We present novel methods to characterize the structure of the 31-dimensional set of feasible muscle activations for static force production in every 3-D direction. We find that task requirements strongly define the set of feasible muscle activations and limb forces, with few differences comparing individual vs. species-average results. Moreover, muscle activity is not smoothly distributed across 3-D directions. The second example explores parameter uncertainty during a flying disc throwing motion by using a generic human arm with five DoFs and 17 muscles to predict muscle fiber velocities. We show that the measured joint kinematics fully constrain the eccentric and concentric fiber velocities of all muscles via their moment arms. Thus muscle activation for limb movements is likely not redundant: there is little, if any, latitude in synchronizing alpha-gamma motoneuron excitation-inhibition for muscles to adhere to the time-critical fiber velocities dictated by joint kinematics. Importantly, several muscles inevitably exhibit fiber velocities higher than thought tenable, even for conservative throwing speeds. These techniques and results, respectively, enable and compel us to continue to revise the classical notion of muscle redundancy for increasingly more realistic models and tasks.},

The development and implementation of robots for elder-care applications, and the development of human-augmentation technologies, mean that robots could be working alongside humans in looking after and rehabilitating people”. In this spirit, we explore here a methodology to enable greater maneuverability and interactivity of robots in human environments (Figure 2.1). As the expectation of humanoid robots to operate as human helpers and social companions grows, the need to improve their motor skills becomes increasingly important. Equipped with highly dexterous anthropomorphic systems, sensors for environmental awareness, and powerful computers, humanoids should be capable of handling many basic chores that humans do.

Biomechanical research has been dominated by the use of lever models and their kinematic analysis, which has largely ignored the geometric organization of these ubiquitous and evolutionary-conserved systems, yet CKCs contribute substantially to our understanding of biological motion. Closed-chain kinematics couple multiple parts into continuous mechanical loops that allow the structure itself to regulate complex movements, and are described in a wide variety of different organisms, including humans. In a biological context, CKCs are modular units nested within others at multiple size scales as part of an integrated movement system that extends throughout the organism and can act in synergy with the nervous system, where present. They provide an energy-efficient mechanism that enables multiple mechanical functions to be optimized during embryological development and increases evolutionary diversity.},

abstract = {In a companion paper a new functional architecture was proposed for the basal ganglia based on the premise that these brain structures play a central role in behavioural action selection. The current paper quantitatively describes the properties of the model using analysis and simulation. The decomposition of the basal ganglia into selection and control pathways is supported in several ways. First, several elegant features are exposed–capacity scaling, enhanced selectivity and synergistic dopamine modulation–which might be expected to exist in a well designed action selection mechanism. The discovery of these features also lends support to the computational premise of selection that underpins our model. Second, good matches between model globus pallidus external segment output and globus pallidus internal segment and substantia nigra reticulata area output, and neurophysiological data, have been found which are indicative of common architectural features in the model and biological basal ganglia. Third, the behaviour of the model as a signal selection mechanism has parallels with some kinds of action selection observed in animals under various levels of dopaminergic modulation.},

@article{Erdemir2007,
abstract = {Estimation of individual muscle forces during human movement can provide insight into neural control and tissue loading and can thus contribute to improved diagnosis and management of both neurological and orthopaedic conditions. Direct measurement of muscle forces is generally not feasible in a clinical setting, and non-invasive methods based on musculoskeletal modeling should therefore be considered. The current state of the art in clinical movement analysis is that resultant joint torques can be reliably estimated from motion data and external forces (inverse dynamic analysis). Static optimization methods to transform joint torques into estimates of individual muscle forces using musculoskeletal models, have been known for several decades. To date however, none of these methods have been successfully translated into clinical practice. The main obstacles are the lack of studies reporting successful validation of muscle force estimates, and the lack of user-friendly and efficient computer software. Recent advances in forward dynamics methods have opened up new opportunities. Forward dynamic optimization can be performed such that solutions are less dependent on measured kinematics and ground reaction forces, and are consistent with additional knowledge, such as the force-length-velocity-activation relationships of the muscles, and with observed electromyography signals during movement. We conclude that clinical applications of current research should be encouraged, supported by further development of computational tools and research into new algorithms for muscle force estimation and their validation.},

abstract = {The goal of this work was to determine how force loads applied at the hand change the elastic mechanical properties of the arm. Endpoint stiffness, which characterizes the relationship between hand displacements and the forces required to effect those displacements, was estimated during the application of planar, stochastic displacement perturbations to the human arm. A nonparametric system identification algorithm was used to estimate endpoint stiffness from the measured force and displacement data. We found that changes in the elastic component of arm stiffness during isometric force regulation tasks were due primarily to the actions of the single-joint muscles spanning the shoulder and elbow. This was shown to result in a nearly posture-independent regulation of joint torque-stiffness relationships, suggesting a simplified strategy that is used to regulate arm mechanics during these tasks.},

Rabitz) we search Science Online to identify and then review all recent articles having "sensitivity analysis" as a keyword. In spite of the considerable developments which have taken place in this discipline, of the good practices which have emerged, and of existing guidelines for SA issued on both sides of the Atlantic, we could not find in our review other than very primitive SA tools, based on "one-factor-at-a-time" (OAT) approaches. In the context of model corroboration or falsification, we demonstrate that this use of OAT methods is illicit and unjustified, unless the model under analysis is proved to be linear. We show that available good practices, such as variance based measures and others, are able to overcome OAT shortcomings and easy to implement. These methods also allow the concept of factors importance to be defined rigorously, thus making the factors importance ranking univocal. We analyse the requirements of SA in the context of modelling, and present best available practices on the basis of an elementary model. We also point the reader to available recipes for a rigorous SA. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Some of these neurons encode the locations of stimuli with respect to the arm, and may be useful for guiding movements of the arm. Others encode the locations of stimuli with respect to the head, and may be useful for guiding movements of the head. We suggest that a general principle of sensory—motor integration is that the space surrounding the body is represented in body-part-centered coordinates. That is, there are multiple coordinate systems used to guide movement, each one attached to a different part of the body. This and other recent evidence from both monkeys and humans suggest that the formation of spatial maps in the brain and the guidance of limb and body movements do not proceed in separate stages but are closely integrated in both the parietal and frontal lobes.},

We then test it for a variety of compliant whole-body behaviors including balance and kinesthetic mobility on irregular terrain, and Cartesian hand position tracking using the co-actuated (i.e. two joints are simultaneously actuated with one motor) robot's upper body. The implementation serves as a hardware proof for a variety of whole-body control concepts that had previously been developed and tested in simulation. First, behaviors of two and three priority tasks are implemented and successfully executed on the humanoid hardware. In particular, first and second priority tasks are linearized in the task space through model feedback and then controlled through task accelerations. Postures, on the other hand, are shown to be asymptotically stable when using prioritized whole-body control structures and then successfully tested in the real hardware. To cope with irregular terrains, the base is modeled as a six degree of freedom floating system and the wheels are characterized through contact and rolling constraints. Finally, center of mass balance capabilities using whole-body compliant control and kinesthetic mobility are implemented and tested in the humanoid hardware to climb terrains with various slopes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Some historical remarks show that multibody system dynamics is based on classical mechanics and its engineering applications ranging from mechanisms, gyroscopes, satellites and robots to biomechanics. The state-of-the-art in rigid multibody systems is presented with reference to textbooks and proceedings. Multibody system dynamics is characterized by algorithms or formalisms, respectively, ready for computer implementation. As a result simulation and animation are most important. The state-of-the-art in flexible multibody systems is considered in a companion review by Shabana. Future research fields in multibody dynamics are identified as standardization of data, coupling with CAD systems, parameter identification, real-time animation, contact and impact problems, extension to control and mechatronic systems, optimal system design, strength analysis and interaction with fluids. Further, there is a strong interest on multibody systems in analytical and numerical mathematics resulting in reduction methods for rigorous treatment of simple models and special integration codes for ODE and DAE representations supporting the numerical efficiency. New software engineering tools with modular approaches promise improved efficiency still required for the more demanding needs in biomechanics, robotics and vehicle dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic model of a knee joint interacting with a two-link exoskeleton for investigating the effects of different exoskeleton designs on internal joint forces. The closed kinematic chain of the leg and exoskeleton has a significant effect on the joint forces in the knee. A bio-joint model is used to capture this effect by relaxing a commonly made assumption that approximates a knee joint as a perfect engineering pin-joint in exoskeleton design. Based on the knowledge of a knee-joint kinematics, an adaptive knee-joint exoskeleton has been designed by incorporating different kinematic components (such as a pin, slider and cam profile). This design potentially eliminates the negative effects associated with the closed leg/exoskeleton kinematic chain on a human knee. An investigation in the flexion motion of an artificial human knee joint is presented to compare performances of five exoskeleton designs against the case with no exoskeletons. Analytical results that estimate internal forces using the dynamic model (based on the properties of a knee joint) agree well with the experiments. These studies lead to an adaptive mechanism with a slider/cam as an alternative to pin joints for the exoskeleton, and illustrate the application of the model for designing an adaptive mechanism that minimizes internal joint forces due to a human-exoskeleton interaction.},

abstract = {According to the equilibrium trajectory hypothesis, multi-joint arm movements are achieved by gradually shifting the hand equilibrium positions defined by the neuromuscular activity. The magnitude of the force exerted on the arm, at any time, depends on the difference between the actual and equilibrium hand positions and the stiffness and viscosity about the equilibrium position. The purpose of this paper is to test the validity and implications of this hypothesis in the context of reaching movements. A mathematical description of the behavior of an arm tracking the equilibrium trajectory was developed and implemented in computer simulations. The joint stiffness parameters used in these simulations were derived from experimentally measured static stiffness values. The kinematic features of hand equilibrium trajectories which were derived from measured planar horizontal movements gave rise to the suggestion that the generation of reaching movements involves explicit planning of spatially and temporally invariant hand equilibrium trajectories. This hypothesis was tested by simulating actual arm movements based on hypothetical equilibrium trajectories. The success of the predicted behavior in capturing both the qualitative features and the quantitative kinematic details of the measured movements supports the equilibrium trajectory hypothesis. The control strategy suggested here may allow the motor system to avoid some of the complicated computational problems associated with multi-joint arm movements.},

abstract = {A model of muscle energy expenditure was developed for predicting thermal, as well as mechanical energy liberation during simulated muscle contractions. The model was designed to yield energy (heat and work) rate predictions appropriate for human skeletal muscle contracting at normal body temperature. The basic form of the present model is similar to many previous models of muscle energy expenditure, but parameter values were based almost entirely on mammalian muscle data, with preference given to human data where possible. Nonlinear phenomena associated with submaximal activation were also incorporated. The muscle energy model was evaluated at varying levels of complexity, ranging from simulated contractions of isolated muscle, to simulations of whole body locomotion. In all cases, acceptable agreement was found between simulated and experimental energy liberation. The present model should be useful in future studies of the energetics of human movement using forward dynamic computer simulation.},

abstract = {When analyzing complex biomechanical problems such as predicting the effects of orthopedic surgery, subject-specific musculoskeletal models are essential to achieve reliable predictions. The aim of this paper is to present the Twente Lower Extremity Model 2.0, a new comprehensive dataset of the musculoskeletal geometry of the lower extremity, which is based on medical imaging data and dissection performed on the right lower extremity of a fresh male cadaver. Bone, muscle and subcutaneous fat (including skin) volumes were segmented from computed tomography and magnetic resonance images scans. Inertial parameters were estimated from the image-based segmented volumes. A complete cadaver dissection was performed, in which bony landmarks, attachments sites and lines-of-action of 55 muscle actuators and 12 ligaments, bony wrapping surfaces, and joint geometry were measured. The obtained musculoskeletal geometry dataset was finally implemented in the AnyBody Modeling System™ (AnyBody Technology A/S, Aalborg, Denmark), resulting in a model consisting of 12 segments, 11 joints and 21 degrees of freedom, and including 166 muscle–tendon elements for each leg. The new TLEM 2.0 dataset was purposely built to be easily combined with novel image-based scaling techniques, such as bone surface morphing, muscle volume registration and muscle–tendon path identification, in order to obtain subject-specific musculoskeletal models in a quick and accurate way. The complete dataset, including CT and MRI scans and segmented volume and surfaces, is made available at http://www.utwente.nl/ctw/bw/research/projects/TLEMsafe for the biomechanical community, in order to accelerate the development and adoption of subject-specific models on large scale.

abstract = {We have developed a model of the human lower extremity to study how surgical changes in musculoskeletal geometry and musculotendon parameters affect muscle force and its moment about the joints. The lines of action of 43 musculotendon actuators were defined based on their anatomical relationships to three-dimensional bone surface representations. A model for each actuator was formulated to compute its isometric force-length relation. The kinematics of the lower extremity were defined by modeling the hip, knee, ankle, subtalar, and metatarsophalangeal joints. Thus, the force and joint moment that each musculotendon actuator develops can be computed for any body position. The joint moments calculated with the model compare well with experimentally measured isometric joint moments. We developed a graphical interface to the model that allows the user to visualize the musculoskeletal geometry and to manipulate the model parameters to study the biomechanical consequences of orthopaedic surgical procedures. For example, tendon transfer and lengthening procedures can be simulated by adjusting the model parameters according to various surgical techniques. Results of the simulated surgeries can be analyzed quickly in terms of postsurgery muscle forces and other biomechanical variables. Just as interactive graphics have enhanced engineering design and analysis, we have found that graphics-based musculoskeletal models are effective tools for designing and analyzing surgical procedures.},

abstract = {Persons with cerebral palsy frequently walk with excessive knee flexion during terminal swing and stance. This gait abnormality is often attributed to "short" or "spastic" hamstrings that restrict knee extension, and is often treated by hamstrings lengthening surgery. At present, the outcomes of these procedures are inconsistent. This study examined whether analyses of the muscle-tendon lengths and lengthening velocities of patients' hamstrings during walking may be helpful when deciding whether a candidate is likely to benefit from hamstrings surgery. One hundred and fifty-two subjects were cross-classified in a series of multi-way contingency tables based on their pre- and postoperative gait kinematics, muscle-tendon lengths, muscle-tendon velocities, and hamstrings surgeries. The lengths and velocities of the subjects' semimembranosus muscles were estimated by combining kinematic data from gait analysis with a three-dimensional computer model of the lower extremity. Log-linear analysis revealed that the subjects who walked with abnormally "short" or "slow" hamstrings preoperatively, and whose hamstrings did not operate at longer lengths or faster velocities postoperatively, were unlikely to walk with improved knee extension after treatment (p {\textless} 0.05). Subjects who did not walk with abnormally short or slow hamstrings preoperatively, and whose hamstrings did operate at longer lengths or faster velocities postoperatively, tended to exhibit unimproved or worsened anterior pelvic tilt after treatment (p {\textless} 0.05). Examination of the muscle-tendon lengths and velocities allows individuals who walk with abnormally short or slow hamstrings to be distinguished from those who do not, and thus may help to identify patients who are at risk for unsatisfactory postsurgical changes in knee extension or anterior pelvic tilt.},

We introduce quaternion mathematics and discuss why quaternions are a better choice for implementing rotation than the well-known matrix implementations. We then treat di erent methods for interpolation between series of rotations. During this treatment we give complete proofs for the correctness of the important interpolation methods Slerp and Squad. Inspired by our treatment of the di erent interpolation methods we develop our own interpolation method called Spring based on a set of objective constraints for an optimal interpolation curve. This results in a set of di erential equations, whose analytical solution meets these constraints. Unfortunately, the set of di erential equations cannot be solved analytically. As an alternative we propose a numerical solution for the di erential equations. The di erent interpolation methods are visualized and commented. Finally we provide a thorough comparison of the two most convincing methods (Spring and Squad). Thereby, this report provides a comprehensive treatment of quaternions, rotation with quaternions, and interpolation curves for series of rotations.},

abstract = {Oscillatory rhythms in different frequency ranges mark different behavioral states and are thought to provide distinct temporal windows that coherently bind cooperating neuronal assemblies. However, the rhythms in different bands can also interact with each other, suggesting the possibility of higher-order representations of brain states by such rhythmic activity. To explore this possibility, we analyzed local field potential oscillations recorded simultaneously from the striatum and the hippocampus. As rats performed a task requiring active navigation and decision making, the amplitudes of multiple high-frequency oscillations were dynamically modulated in task-dependent patterns by the phase of cooccurring theta-band oscillations both within and across these structures, particularly during decision-making behavioral epochs. Moreover, the modulation patterns uncovered distinctions among both high- and low-frequency subbands. Cross-frequency coupling of multiple neuronal rhythms could be a general mechanism used by the brain to perform network-level dynamical computations underlying voluntary behavior.},

abstract = {Synapses are highly plastic and are modified by changes in patterns of neural activity or sensory experience. Plasticity of cortical excitatory synapses is thought to be important for learning and memory, leading to alterations in sensory representations and cognitive maps. However, these changes must be coordinated across other synapses within local circuits to preserve neural coding schemes and the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, i.e., excitatory-inhibitory balance. Recent studies indicate that inhibitory synapses are also plastic and are controlled directly by a large number of neuromodulators, particularly during episodes of learning. Many modulators transiently alter excitatory-inhibitory balance by decreasing inhibition, and thus disinhibition has emerged as a major mechanism by which neuromodulation might enable long-term synaptic modifications naturally. This review examines the relationships between neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity, focusing on the induction of long-term changes that collectively enhance cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance for improving perception and behavior.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To improve design of robotic lower limb exoskeletons for gait rehabilitation, it is critical to identify neural mechanisms that govern locomotor adaptation to robotic assistance. Previously, we demonstrated soleus muscle recruitment decreased by approximately 35{\%} when walking with a pneumatically-powered ankle exoskeleton providing plantar flexor torque under soleus proportional myoelectric control. Since a substantial portion of soleus activation during walking results from the stretch reflex, increased reflex inhibition is one potential mechanism for reducing soleus recruitment when walking with exoskeleton assistance. This is clinically relevant because many neurologically impaired populations have hyperactive stretch reflexes and training to reduce the reflexes could lead to substantial improvements in their motor ability. The purpose of this study was to quantify soleus Hoffmann (H-) reflex responses during powered versus unpowered walking. METHODS: We tested soleus H-reflex responses in neurologically intact subjects (n=8) that had trained walking with the soleus controlled robotic ankle exoskeleton. Soleus H-reflex was tested at the mid and late stance while subjects walked with the exoskeleton on the treadmill at 1.25 m/s, first without power (first unpowered), then with power (powered), and finally without power again (second unpowered). We also collected joint kinematics and electromyography. RESULTS: When the robotic plantar flexor torque was provided, subjects walked with lower soleus electromyographic (EMG) activation (27-48{\%}) and had concomitant reductions in H-reflex amplitude (12-24{\%}) compared to the first unpowered condition. The H-reflex amplitude in proportion to the background soleus EMG during powered walking was not significantly different from the two unpowered conditions. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the nervous system does not inhibit the soleus H-reflex in response to short-term adaption to exoskeleton assistance. Future studies should determine if the findings also apply to long-term adaption to the exoskeleton.},

abstract = {Oscillations in the primary motor cortex are transmitted through the corticospinal tract to the motoneuron pool. This pathway is believed to produce an effective and direct command from the motor cortex to the spinal motoneurons for the modulation of the force output. In this study, we used a computational model of a population of motoneurons to investigate the factors that can influence the transmission of the cortical input to the output of motoneurons, since it can be quantified by coherence analysis. The simulations demonstrated that, despite the nonlinearity of the motoneurons, oscillations present in the cortical input are transmitted to the output of the motoneuron pool at the same frequency. However, the interference introduced by the nonlinearity of the system increases the variability of the oscillations in output, introducing spectral lines whose frequency depends on the input frequencies and the motoneuron discharge rates. Moreover, an additional source of synaptic input common to all motoneurons but independent from the corticospinal component decorrelates the cortical input and motoneuron output and, thus, decreases the magnitude of the estimated coherence, even if the effective cortical drive does not change. These results indicate that the corticospinal input can effectively be sampled by a small population of motoneurons. However, the transmission of a corticospinal drive to the motoneuron pool is influenced by the nonlinearity of the spiking processes of the active motoneurons and by synaptic inputs common to the motoneuron population but independent from the cortical input.},

abstract = {Muscles coordinate multijoint motion by generating forces that cause reaction forces throughout the body. Thus, a muscle can redistribute existing segmental energy by accelerating some segments and decelerating others. In the process, a muscle may also produce or absorb energy, in which case its summed energetic effect on the segments is positive or negative, respectively. This Borelli Lecture shows how dynamical simulations derived from musculoskeletal models reveal muscle-induced segmental energy redistribution and muscle co-functions and synergies. Synergy occurs when co-excited muscles distribute segmental energy differently to execute the motor task. In maximum height jumping, high vertical velocity at lift-off occurs desirably at full body extension because biarticular leg muscles redistribute the energy produced by the uniarticular leg muscles. In pedaling, synergistic ankle plantarflexor force generation during leg extension allows the high energy produced by the uniarticular hip and knee extensors to be delivered to the crank. An analogous less-powerful flexor synergy exists during leg flexion. Hamstrings reduce crank deceleration during the leg extension-to-flexion transition by not only producing energy but delivering it to the crank through its contribution to the tangential (accelerating) crank force, though this hamstrings function occurs at the opposite (flexion-extension) transition when pedaling backwards. In walking, the eccentric quadriceps activity in early stance not only decelerates the leg but also accelerates the trunk. In mid-stance, the uni- and biarticular plantarflexors, by having opposite segmental energetic effects, act in synergy to support the whole body, so segmental potential and kinetic energy exchange can occur. To conclude, the extraction of unmeasurable variables from dynamical simulations emulating task kinematics, kinetics, and EMGs shows how the production of force and energy by individual muscles contribute to the energy flow among the individual segments during task execution.},

abstract = {Accurate models of proprioceptive neural patterns could 1 day play an important role in the creation of an intuitive proprioceptive neural prosthesis for amputees. This paper looks at combining efficient implementations of biomechanical and proprioceptor models in order to generate signals that mimic human muscular proprioceptive patterns for future experimental work in prosthesis feedback. A neuro-musculoskeletal model of the upper limb with 7 degrees of freedom and 17 muscles is presented and generates real time estimates of muscle spindle and Golgi Tendon Organ neural firing patterns. Unlike previous neuro-musculoskeletal models, muscle activation and excitation levels are unknowns in this application and an inverse dynamics tool (static optimization) is integrated to estimate these variables. A proprioceptive prosthesis will need to be portable and this is incompatible with the computationally demanding nature of standard biomechanical and proprioceptor modeling.

abstract = {Physical interactivity is a major challenge in humanoid robot-ics. To allow robots to operate in human environments there is a pressing need for the development of control architectures that provide the advanced capabilities and interactive skills needed to effectively interact with the environment and/or the human partner while performing useful manipulation and locomotion tasks. Such architectures must address the robot whole-body control problem in its most general form: task and whole body motion coordination with active force control at contacts, under various constraints, self collision, and dynamic obstacles. In this paper we present a framework that addresses in a unified fashion the whole-body control problem in the context of multi-point multi-link contacts, constraints, and obstacles. The effectiveness of this novel formulation is illustrated through extensive robot dynamic simulations conducted in SAI, and the experimental validation of the framework is currently underway on the ASIMO platform.},

abstract = {Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated figures are based exclusively on reduced-coordinate formulations. This pa- per describes a general, non-iterative linear-time simulationmethod based instead on Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange multiplier meth- ods are important for computer graphics applications because they bypass the difficult (and often intractable) problem of parameter- izing a systems degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality constraints acting between pairs of bodies, the method takes O(n) time to compute the systems dynamics. The method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no assumptions about the con- straints topology are needed. Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can be of various dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate ap- proaches, nonholonomic (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional constraints which induce loops and/or handle inequalities can be accommodated with cost O(kn). Thismakes it practical to simulate complicated, closed- loop articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at interactive rates. A complete description of a sample implementation is pro- vided in pseudocode.},

abstract = {Many advanced motion control strategies developed in robotics use captured human motion data as valuable source of examples to simplify the process of programming or learning complex robot motions. Direct and online control of robots from observed human motion has several inherent challenges. The most important may be the representation of the large number of mechanical degrees of freedom involved in the execution of movement tasks. Attempting to map all such degrees of freedom from a human to a humanoid is a formidable task from an instrumentation and sensing point of view. More importantly, such an approach is incompatible with mechanisms in the central nervous system which are believed to organize or simplify the control of these degrees of freedom during motion execution and motor learning phase. Rather than specifying the desired motion of every degree of freedom for the purpose of motion control, it is important to describe motion by low dimensional motion primitives that are defined in Cartesian (or task) space. In this paper, we formulate the human to humanoid retargeting problem as a task space control problem. The control objective is to track desired task descriptors while satisfying constraints such as joint limits, velocity limits, collision avoidance, and balance. The retargeting algorithm generates the joint space trajectories that are commanded to the robot. We present experimental and simulation results of the retargeting control algorithm on the Honda humanoid robot ASIMO.},

abstract = {The physical properties of our bodies are subject to change (due to fatigue, heavy equipment, injury or aging) as we move around in the surrounding environment. The traditional definition of motor adaptation dictates that a mechanism in our brain needs to compensate for such alterations by appropriately modifying neural motor commands, if the vitally important accuracy of executed movements is to be preserved. In this article we describe how a repetitive eye movement task brings about changes in eye saccade kinematics that compromise accurate motor performance in the absence of a proper compensatory response. Surgical lesions in animals and human patient studies have previously demonstrated that an intact cerebellum is necessary for the compensation to arise and prevent the occurrence of hypometric movements. Here we identified the dynamic properties of the eye plant by recording from abducens motoneurons responsible for the required movement and measured the muscle response to microstimulation of the abducens nucleus in rhesus monkeys. The ensuing results demonstrate that the muscular periphery remains intact during the fatiguing eye movement task, while internal sources of noise (drowsiness, attentional modulation, neuronal fatigue etc.) must be responsible for a diminished oculomotor performance. This finding leads to the important realization that while supervising the accuracy of our movements, the nervous system takes additionally into account and adapts to any disruptive processes within the brain itself, clearly unrelated to the dynamical behavior of muscles or the environment. The existence of this supplementary mechanism forces a reassessment of traditional views of cerebellum-dependent motor adaptation.},

However, the interpretation depends on the choice of reference frame, but the different reference frames have not been compared in dynamic, high-impact sporting movements. We have compared the magnitude and the resulting ranking of hip and knee joint moments expressed in the laboratory coordinate system, the local system of the distal segment and projected or decomposed to the Joint Coordinate System (JCS) axes. Hip and knee joint moments of drop jumps and sidestep cutting in 70 elite female handball players were calculated based on recordings from an eight-camera 240. Hz system and two force platforms and expressed with the four methods. The greatest variations in magnitude between conditions were seen for drop jump hip internal rotation (range: 0.31-0.71. Nm/kg) and sidestep cutting knee flexion (2.87-3.39. Nm/kg) and hip internal rotation (0.87-2.36. Nm/kg) and knee internal rotation (0.10-0.40. Nm/kg) moments. The rank correlations were highest between conditions for flexion moments (0.88-1.00) and sidestep cutting abduction moments (0.71-0.98). The rank correlations ranged from 0.64 to 0.73 for drop jump knee abduction moments and between -0.17 and 0.67 for hip and knee internal rotation moments. Expression of joint moments in different reference systems affects the magnitude and ranking of athletes. This lack of consistency may complicate the comparison and combination of results. Projection to the JCS is the only method where joint moments correspond to muscle and ligament loading. More widespread adoption of this convention could facilitate comparison of studies and ease the interpretation of results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

While excessive contact pressure is considered to be a possible aggressor, it is not clear whether and to what extent stress on the cartilage during kneeling is different from that while standing. In this study, finite element models of the knee joint for both kneeling and standing positions were constructed. The results indicated differences in high-stress regions between kneeling and standing. And both the peak von-Mises stress and contact pressure on the cartilage were larger in kneeling. During kneeling, the contact pressure reached 4.25. MPa under a 300. N compressive load. It then increased to 4.66. MPa at 600. N and 5.15. MPa at 1000. N. Changing the Poisson's ratio of the cartilage, which represents changes in compressibility caused by different loading rates, was found to have an influence on the magnitude of stress. {\textcopyright} 2014 IPEM.},

abstract = {Estimation of muscle forces during motion involves solving an indeterminate problem (more unknown muscle forces than joint moment constraints), frequently via optimization methods. When the dynamics of muscle activation and contraction are modeled for consistency with muscle physiology, the resulting optimization problem is dynamic and challenging to solve. This study sought to identify a robust and computationally efficient formulation for solving these dynamic optimization problems using direct collocation optimal control methods. Four problem formulations were investigated for walking based on both a two and three dimensional model. Formulations differed in the use of either an explicit or implicit representation of contraction dynamics with either muscle length or tendon force as a state variable. The implicit representations introduced additional controls defined as the time derivatives of the states, allowing the nonlinear equations describing contraction dynamics to be imposed as algebraic path constraints, simplifying their evaluation. Problem formulation affected computational speed and robustness to the initial guess. The formulation that used explicit contraction dynamics with muscle length as a state failed to converge in most cases. In contrast, the two formulations that used implicit contraction dynamics converged to an optimal solution in all cases for all initial guesses, with tendon force as a state generally being the fastest. Future work should focus on comparing the present approach to other approaches for computing muscle forces. The present approach lacks some of the major limitations of established methods such as static optimization and computed muscle control while remaining computationally efficient.},

abstract = {OpenSim provides to its biomechanics users a calculation called “muscle moment arm” which captures to some degree the leverage of a particular muscle with respect to a particular joint, while in a given configuration. For simple cases, this is the same as the conventional moment arm calculation in mechanical engineering. A straight-line muscle whose origin and insertion points connect two adjacent bodies connected by a pin joint is the simplest case. In practice, however, a muscle may span several joints (wrist, neck, spine) and will follow a contorted crossing over various curved bone surfaces. For these situations we need a careful definition of “muscle moment arm” that is analogous to the mechanical engineering concept and of use to biomedical researchers. There are other related quantities that can easily be confused with moment arm, such as the amount of joint acceleration that a muscle can produce. That will be equivalent to moment arm in simple cases but confusingly different in more complex situations. Here we will give a precise definition of what we mean by “muscle moment arm” and, given that definition, how that quantity may be efficiently calculated. We will not attempt to address any deeper questions such as when you should be interested in moment arm or how you should use it.},

abstract = {Abstract-Gait modification is a nonsurgical approach for reducing the external knee adduction torque in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The magnitude of the first adduction torque peak in particular is strongly associated with knee OA progression. While toeing out has been shown to reduce the second peak, no clinically realistic gait modifications have been identified that effectively reduce both peaks simultaneously. This study predicts novel patient-specific gait modifications that achieve this goal without changing the foot path. The modified gait motion was designed for a single patient with knee OA using dynamic optimization of a patient-specific, full-body gait model. The cost function minimized the knee adduction torque subject to constraints limiting how much the new gait motion could deviate from the patient's normal gait motion. The optimizations predicted a "medial-thrust" gait pattern that reduced the first adduction torque peak between 32{\%} and 54{\%} and the second peak between 34{\%} and 56{\%}. The new motion involved three synergistic kinematic changes: slightly decreased pelvis obliquity, slightly increased leg flexion, and slightly increased pelvis axial rotation. After gait retraining, the patient achieved adduction torque reductions of 39{\%} to 50{\%} in the first peak and 37{\%} to 55{\%} in the second one. These reductions are comparable to those reported after high tibial osteotomy surgery. The associated kinematic changes were consistent with the predictions except for pelvis obliquity, which showed little change. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to design novel patient-specific gait modifications with potential clinical benefit using dynamic optimization of patient-specific, full-body gait models. Further investigation is needed to assess the extent to which similar gait modifications may be effective for other patients with knee OA.},

When applied to dynamic musculoskeletal models such optimality principles might be used to predict how a patient's gait adapts to mechanical interventions such as prosthetic devices or surgery. In this paper we study the effects of different performance criteria on predicted gait patterns using a 2D musculoskeletal model. The associated optimal control problem for a family of different cost functions was solved utilizing the direct collocation method. It was found that fatigue-like cost functions produced realistic gait, with stance phase knee flexion, as opposed to energy-related cost functions which avoided knee flexion during the stance phase. We conclude that fatigue minimization may be one of the primary optimality principles governing human gait. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The central goal of this study was to contribute to the advancements being made in determining the underlying causes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. ACL injuries are frequently incurred by recreational and professional young female athletes during non-contact impact activities in sports like volleyball and basketball. This musculoskeletal-neuromuscular study investigated stop-jumps and factors related to ACL injury like knee valgus and internal-external moment loads, knee anterior-posterior (AP) shear forces, ACL strains and internal forces. Motion capture data was obtained from the landing phase of stop-jumps performed by eleven young recreational female athletes and electromyography (EMG) data collected from quadriceps, hamstring and gastrocnimius muscles which were then compared to numerically estimated activations. Numerical simulation tools used were Inverse Kinematics, Computed Muscle Control and Forward Dynamics and the knee modeled as a six degree of freedom joint. Results showed averaged peak strains of 12.2 ± 4.1{\%} in the right and 11.9 ± 3.0{\%} in the left ACL. Averaged peak knee AP shear forces were 482.3 ± 65.7 N for the right and 430.0 ± 52.4 N for the left knees, approximately equal to 0.7-0.8 times body weight across both knees. A lack of symmetry was observed between the knees for valgus angles (p {\textless} 0.04), valgus moments (p {\textless} 0.001) and muscle activations (p {\textless} 0.001), all of which can be detrimental to ACL stability during impact activities. Comparisons between recorded EMG data and estimated muscle activations show the relation between electrical signal and muscle depolarization. In summary, this study outlines a musculoskeletal simulation approach that provides numerical estimations for a number of variables associated with ACL injuries in female athletes performing stop-jumps.},

abstract = {Consciousness is a topic of considerable human curiosity with a long history of philosophical analysis and debate. We consider there is nothing particularly complicated about consciousness when viewed as a necessary process of the vertebrate nervous system. Here, we propose a physiological "explanatory gap" is created during each present moment by the temporal requirements of neuronal activity. The gap extends from the time exteroceptive and proprioceptive stimuli activate the nervous system until they emerge into consciousness. During this "moment", it is impossible for an organism to have any conscious knowledge of the ongoing evolution of its environment. In our schematic model, a mechanism of "afference copy" is employed to bridge the explanatory gap with consciously experienced percepts. These percepts are fabricated from the conjunction of the cumulative memory of previous relevant experience and the given stimuli. They are structured to provide the best possible prediction of the expected content of subjective conscious experience likely to occur during the period of the gap. The model is based on the proposition that the neural circuitry necessary to support consciousness is a product of sub/preconscious reflexive learning and recall processes. Based on a review of various psychological and neurophysiological findings, we develop a framework which contextualizes the model and briefly discuss further implications.},

abstract = {In this thesis I present the Recurrent Error-driven Adaptive Control Hierarchy (REACH); a large-scale spiking neuron model of the motor cortices and cerebellum of the motor control system. The REACH model consists of anatomically organized spiking neurons that control a nonlinear three-link arm to perform reaching and handwriting, while being able to adapt to unknown changes in arm dynamics and structure. I show that the REACH model accounts for data across 19 clinical and experimental studies of the motor control system. These data includes a mix of behavioural and neural spiking activity, across normal and damaged subjects performing adaptive and static tasks. The REACH model is a dynamical control system based on modern control theoretic methods, specifically operational space control, dynamic movement primitives, and nonlinear adaptive control. The model is implemented in spiking neurons using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF). The model plans trajectories in end-effector space, and transforms these commands into joint torques that can be sent to the arm simulation. Adaptive components of the model are able to compensate for unknown kinematic or dynamic system parameters, such as arm segment length or mass. Using the NEF the adaptive components of the system can be seeded with approximations of the system kinematics and dynamics, allowing faster convergence to stability. Stability proofs for nonlinear adaptation methods implemented in distributed systems with scalar output are presented. By implementing the motor control model in spiking neurons, biological constraints such as neurotransmitter time-constants and anatomical connectivity can be imposed, allowing further comparison to experimental data for model validation. The REACH model is compared to clinical data from human patients as well as neural recording from monkeys performing reaching experiments. The REACH model represents a novel integration of control theoretic methods and neuroscientific constraints to specify a general, adaptive, biologically plausible motor control algorithm.},

An example of such a relation is the energy relation in conservative systems or the analytical relation generated by an outer holonomic or non-holonomic constraint provided the Lagrange equations of the first kind are used. It is shown that, in general, the computed numerical values of the solution satisfy such analytic relations with poor accuracy. The aim of the paper is to show how the analytical relations can be satisfied in a stabilized manner in order to improve the numerical accuracy of the solution of the differential equations. The proposed method leads to a modified differential system which is often stable in the sense of Ljapunov, whereas the original system is unstable. ?? 1972.},

An operational space approach, adapted from the field of robotics, is used for this purpose. This approach is augmented by a significant new extension directed at addressing the control of muscle-driven systems. ask/posture decomposition is intrinsically exploited, allowing human musculoskeletal properties to direct postural behavior during the performance of a task. This paper also describes a simulation architecture for generating musculoskeletal simulations of human characters. The evolving capabilities of the collective environment are directed toward 1 Introduction In recent years, there has been an emerging desire to synthetically generate human-like motion in both simulated and physical settings. In the computer graphics community, this desire is directed toward autonomously generating realistic motion for virtual actors [5, 6, 29]. The intent is to direct these virtual actors using high-level goaldirected commands for which low-level motion control is automatically generated. Motivated by similar desires, the robotics community seeks a high-level control framework for robotic systems. With the recent advent of complex humanoid robots [19,25] this challenge grows more demanding. Consistent with their anthropomorphic design, humanoid robots are autonomously generating realistic motion control for virtual actors in interactive computer graphics applications, as well as synthesizing the control of human-like motion in robotic systems.},

abstract = {This study evaluated a procedure for estimating in vivo Achilles tendon (AT) force from ultrasound images. Two aspects of the procedure were tested: (i) accounting for subject-specific AT stiffness and (ii) accounting for changes in the relative electromyographic (EMG) intensities of the three triceps surae muscles. Ten cyclists pedaled at 80??rpm while a comprehensive set of kinematic, kinetic, EMG, and ultrasound data were collected. Subjects were tested at four crank loads, ranging from 14 to 44??N??m (115 to 370??W). AT forces during cycling were estimated from AT length changes and from AT stiffness, which we derived for each subject from ultrasound data and from plantar flexion torques measured during isometric tests. AT length changes were measured by tracking the muscle-tendon junction of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) relative to its insertion on the calcaneus. Because the relative EMG intensities of the triceps surae muscles varied with load during cycling, we divided subjects?? measured AT length changes by a scale factor, defined as the square root of the relative EMG intensity of the MG, weighted by the fractional physiological cross-sectional areas of the three muscles, to estimate force. Subjects?? estimated AT forces during cycling increased with load (p{\textless}0.05). On average, peak forces ranged from 920??96??N (14??N??m, 115??W) to 1510??129??N (44??N??m, 370??W). For most subjects, ankle moments derived from the ultrasound-based AT strains were 5???12{\%} less than the net ankle moments calculated from inverse dynamics (r2=0.71??0.28, RMSE=8.1??0.33??N??m). Differences in the moments increased substantially when we did not account for changes in the muscles?? relative EMG intensities with load or, in some subjects, when we used an average stiffness, rather than a subject-specific value. The proposed methods offer a non-invasive approach for studying in vivo muscle-tendon mechanics.},

abstract = {A phenomenological model for muscle energy consumption was developed and used in conjunction with a simple Hill-type model for muscle contraction. The model was used to address two questions. First, can an empirical model of muscle energetics accurately represent the total energetic behavior of frog muscle in isometric, isotonic, and isokinetic contractions? And second, how does such a model perform in a large-scale, multiple-muscle model of human walking? Four simulations were conducted with frog sartorius muscle under full excitation: an isometric contraction, a set of isotonic contractions with the muscle shortening a constant distance under various applied loads, a set of isotonic contractions with the muscle shortening over various distances under a constant load, and an isokinetic contraction in lengthening. The model calculations were evaluated against results of similar thermal in vitro experiments performed on frog sartorius muscle. The energetics model was then incorporated into a large-scale, multiple-muscle model of the human body for the purpose of predicting energy consumption during normal walking. The total energy estimated by the model accurately reflected the observed experimental behavior of frog muscle for an isometric contraction. The model also accurately reproduced the experimental behavior of frog muscle heat production under isotonic shortening and isokinetic lengthening conditions. The estimated rate of metabolic energy consumption for walking was 29{\%} higher than the value typically obtained from gait measurements. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Interactions between the ventral premotor (PMv) and the primary motor cortex (M1) are crucial for transforming an object's geometrical properties, such as its size and shape, into a motor command suitable for grasp of the object. Recently, we showed that PMv interacts with M1 in a specific fashion, depending on the hand posture. However, the functional connectivity between PMv and M1 during the preparation of an actual grasp is still unknown.

To address this issue, PMv–M1 interactions were tested while subjects were preparing to grasp different visible objects requiring either a precision grip or a whole hand grasp. A conditioning–test transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm was used: a test stimulus was applied over M1 either in isolation or after a conditioning stimulus delivered, at different delays, over the ipsilateral PMv. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded in the first dorsal interosseus and abductor digiti minimi muscles, which show highly differentiated activity according to grasp.

While subjects prepared to grasp, delivering a conditioning PMv pulse 6 or 8 msec before a test pulse over M1 strikingly facilitated MEPs in the specific muscles that were used in the upcoming grasp. This degree of facilitation correlated with the amount of muscle activity used later in the trial to grasp the objects.

The present results demonstrate that, during grasp preparation, the PMv–M1 interactions are muscle-specific. PMv appears to process the object geometrical properties relevant for the upcoming grasp, and transmits this information to M1, which in turn generates a motor command appropriate for the grasp. We also reveal that the grasp-specific facilitation resulting from PMv–M1 interactions is differently related to the upcoming grasp muscle activity than is that from paired-pulse stimulation over M1, suggesting that these two TMS paradigms assess the excitability of cortico-cortical pathways devoted to the control of grasp at two different levels.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new model-based method to define muscle synergies. Unlike the conventional factorization approach, which extracts synergies from electromyographic data, the proposed method employs a biomechanical model and formally defines the synergies as the solution of an optimal control problem. As a result, the number of required synergies is directly related to the dimensions of the operational space. The estimated synergies are posture-dependent, which correlate well with the results of standard factorization methods. Two examples are used to showcase this method: a two-dimensional forearm model, and a three-dimensional driver arm model. It has been shown here that the synergies need to be task-specific (i.e., they are defined for the specific operational spaces: the elbow angle and the steering wheel angle in the two systems). This functional definition of synergies results in a low-dimensional control space, in which every force in the operational space is accurately created by a unique combination of synergies. As such, there is no need for extra criteria (e.g., minimizing effort) in the process of motion control. This approach is motivated by the need for fast and bio-plausible feedback control of musculoskeletal systems, and can have important implications in engineering, motor control, and biomechanics.},

abstract = {Much debate has arisen from research on muscle synergies with respect to both limb impedance control and energy consumption. Studies of limb impedance control in the context of reaching movements and postural tasks have produced divergent findings, and this study explores whether the use of synergies by the central nervous system (CNS) can resolve these findings and also provide insights on mechanisms of energy consumption. In this study, we phrase these debates at the conceptual level of interactions between neural degrees of freedom and tasks constraints. This allows us to examine the ability of experimentally-observed synergies-correlated muscle activations-to control both energy consumption and the stiffness component of limb endpoint impedance. In our nominal 6-muscle planar arm model, muscle synergies and the desired size, shape, and orientation of endpoint stiffness ellipses, are expressed as linear constraints that define the set of feasible muscle activation patterns. Quadratic programming allows us to predict whether and how energy consumption can be minimized throughout the workspace of the limb given those linear constraints. We show that the presence of synergies drastically decreases the ability of the CNS to vary the properties of the endpoint stiffness and can even preclude the ability to minimize energy. Furthermore, the capacity to minimize energy consumption-when available-can be greatly affected by arm posture. Our computational approach helps reconcile divergent findings and conclusions about task-specific regulation of endpoint stiffness and energy consumption in the context of synergies. But more generally, these results provide further evidence that the benefits and disadvantages of muscle synergies go hand-in-hand with the structure of feasible muscle activation patterns afforded by the mechanics of the limb and task constraints. These insights will help design experiments to elucidate the interplay between synergies and the mechanisms of learning, plasticity, versatility and pathology in neuromuscular systems.},

abstract = {Musculoskeletal models are widely used to investigate joint kinematics and predict muscle force during gait. However, the knee is usually simplified as a one degree of freedom joint and knee ligaments are neglected. The aim of this study was to develop an OpenSim gait model with enhanced knee structures. The knee joint in this study included three rotations and three translations. The three knee rotations and mediolateral translation were independent, with proximodistal and anteroposterior translations occurring as a function of knee flexion/extension. Ten elastic elements described the geometrical and mechanical properties of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL), and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL and LCL). The three independent knee rotations were evaluated using OpenSim to observe ligament function. The results showed that the anterior and posterior bundles of ACL and PCL (aACL, pACL and aPCL, pPCL) intersected during knee flexion. The aACL and pACL mainly provided force during knee flexion and adduction, respectively. The aPCL was slack throughout the range of three knee rotations; however, the pPCL was utilised for knee abduction and internal rotation. The LCL was employed for knee adduction and rotation, but was slack beyond 20° of knee flexion. The MCL bundles were mainly used during knee adduction and external rotation. All these results suggest that the functions of knee ligaments in this model approximated the behaviour of the physical knee and the enhanced knee structures can improve the ability to investigate knee joint biomechanics during various gait activities.},

Opening a door, rotating a steering wheel, and pushing a carriage are other typical examples of movements where the physical constraints, imposed on the hand position/orientation, influence the joint angles of the shoulder and the elbow. To predict kinematic and kinetic patterns for human arm movement in crank-rotation tasks, we use an optimization-based technique. The method enables dynamic prediction of closed-chain movements and force exertion using inverse dynamics musculoskeletal simulation. An anatomically detailed musculoskeletal model is parameterized by means of time functions controlling selected degrees-of-freedom. Subsequently, the parameters of these functions are optimized to produce an optimal motion according to a user-defined objective function and constraints given by the anthropometry of the body and physics of the environment. In this study, we use a physiology-based objective function expressing the muscle metabolic energy expenditure and validation metrics to assess the accuracy of the computational model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between predicted results and experimental data from a group of four healthy males indicate that the method reproduces natural kinetic and kinematic patterns.},

abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) have long been implicated in both motor function and dysfunction. It has been proposed that the BG form a centralized action selection circuit, resolving conflict between multiple neural systems competing for access to the final common motor pathway. We present a new spiking neuron model of the BG circuitry to test this proposal, incorporating all major features and many physiologically plausible details. We include the following: effects of dopamine in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP), transmission delays between neurons, and specific distributions of synaptic inputs over dendrites. All main parameters were derived from experimental studies. We find that the BG circuitry supports motor program selection and switching, which deteriorates under dopamine-depleted and dopamine-excessive conditions in a manner consistent with some pathologies associated with those dopamine states. We also validated the model against data describing oscillatory properties of BG. We find that the same model displayed detailed features of both gamma-band (30-80 Hz) and slow (approximately 1 Hz) oscillatory phenomena reported by Brown et al. (2002) and Magill et al. (2001), respectively. Only the parameters required to mimic experimental conditions (e.g., anesthetic) or manipulations (e.g., lesions) were changed. From the results, we derive the following novel predictions about the STN-GP feedback loop: (1) the loop is functionally decoupled by tonic dopamine under normal conditions and recoupled by dopamine depletion; (2) the loop does not show pacemaking activity under normal conditions in vivo (but does after combined dopamine depletion and cortical lesion); (3) the loop has a resonant frequency in the gamma-band.},

abstract = {Matrix factorization algorithms are commonly used to analyze muscle activity and provide insight into neuromuscular control. These algorithms identify low-dimensional subspaces, commonly referred to as synergies, which can describe variation in muscle activity during a task. Synergies are often interpreted as reflecting underlying neural control; however, it is unclear how these analyses are influenced by biomechanical and task constraints, which can also lead to low-dimensional patterns of muscle activation. The aim of this study was to evaluate if commonly used algorithms and experimental methods can accurately identify synergy-based control strategies. This was accomplished by evaluating synergies from five common matrix factorization algorithms using muscle activations calculated from (1) a biomechanically constrained task using a musculoskeletal model and (2) without task constraints using random synergy activations. Although some of the algorithms could accurately estimate specified synergies without biomechanical or task constraints (similarity {\textgreater} 0.7), with these constraints the similarity of estimated synergies decreased significantly (0.3 - 0.4). The ability of these algorithms to accurately identify synergies was negatively impacted by covariance of synergy activations, which are increased when substantial biomechanical or task constraints are present. Increased variability in synergy activations, which can be captured using robust experimental paradigms that include natural variability in motor activation patterns, improved identification accuracy but did not completely overcome effects of biomechanical and task constraints. These results demonstrate that a biomechanically constrained task can reduce the accuracy of estimated synergies and highlight the importance of using experimental protocols with physiological variability to improve synergy analyses.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {It is well-known that muscle redundancy grants the CNS numerous options to perform a task. Does muscle redundancy, however, allow sufficient robustness to compensate for loss or dysfunction of even a single muscle? Are all muscles equally redundant? We combined experimental and computational approaches to establish the limits of motor robustness for static force production. In computer-controlled cadaveric index fingers, we find that only a small subset ({\textless}5{\%}) of feasible forces is robust to loss of any one muscle. Importantly, the loss of certain muscles compromises force production significantly more than others. Further computational modeling of a multi-joint, multi-muscle leg demonstrates that this severe lack of robustness generalizes to whole limbs. These results provide a biomechanical basis to begin to explain why redundant motor systems can be vulnerable to even mild neuromuscular pathology. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Knee ligament injuries are common, particularly in sports and sports related activities. Rupture of these ligaments upsets the balance between knee mobility and stability, resulting in abnormal knee kinematics and damage to other tissues in and around the joint that lead to morbidity and pain. During the past three decades, significant advances have been made in characterizing the biomechanical and biochemical properties of knee ligaments as an individual component as well as their contribution to joint function. Further, significant knowledge on the healing process and replacement of ligaments after rupture have helped to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatment procedures. This review paper provides an overview of the current biological and biomechanical knowledge on normal knee ligaments, as well as ligament healing and reconstruction following injury. Further, it deals with new and exciting functional tissue engineering approaches (ex. growth factors, gene transfer and gene therapy, cell therapy, mechanical factors, and the use of scaffolding materials) aimed at improving the healing of ligaments as well as the interface between a replacement graft and bone. In addition, it explores the anatomical, biological and functional perspectives of current reconstruction procedures. Through the utilization of robotics technology and computational modeling, there is a better understanding of the kinematics of the knee and the in situ forces in knee ligaments and replacement grafts. The research summarized here is multidisciplinary and cutting edge that will ultimately help improve the treatment of ligament injuries. The material presented should serve as an inspiration to future investigators.},

@article{Tehovnik2000,
abstract = {Two eye fields have been identified in the frontal lobes of primates: one is situated dorsomedially within the frontal cortex and will be referred to as the eye field within the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC); the other resides dorsolaterally within the frontal cortex and is commonly referred to as the frontal eye field (FEF). This review documents the similarities and differences between these eye fields. Although the DMFC and FEF are both active during the execution of saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements, the FEF is more dedicated to these functions. Lesions of DMFC minimally affect the production of most types of saccadic eye movements and have no effect on the execution of smooth pursuit eye movements. In contrast, lesions of the FEF produce deficits in generating saccades to briefly presented targets, in the production of saccades to two or more sequentially presented targets, in the selection of simultaneously presented targets, and in the execution of smooth pursuit eye movements. For the most part, these deficits are prevalent in both monkeys and humans. Single-unit recording experiments have shown that the DMFC contains neurons that mediate both limb and eye movements, whereas the FEF seems to be involved in the execution of eye movements only. Imaging experiments conducted on humans have corroborated these findings. A feature that distinguishes the DMFC from the FEF is that the DMFC contains a somatotopic map with eyes represented rostrally and hindlimbs represented caudally; the FEF has no such topography. Furthermore, experiments have revealed that the DMFC tends to contain a craniotopic (i.e., head-centered) code for the execution of saccadic eye movements, whereas the FEF contains a retinotopic (i.e., eye-centered) code for the elicitation of saccades. Imaging and unit recording data suggest that the DMFC is more involved in the learning of new tasks than is the FEF. Also with continued training on behavioural tasks the responsivity of the DMFC tends to drop. Accordingly, the DMFC is more involved in learning operations whereas the FEF is more specialized for the execution of saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements.},

abstract = {In five normal subjects, we analyzed uncalled for torsion (blips) during and after horizontal and vertical saccades. Torsion was defined as movement out of Listing's plane. During horizontal saccades in downward gaze the abducting eye extorted and the adducting eye intorted. The direction of the blips reversed in upward gaze. Peak torsional amplitudes (up to 1-2 deg) were always reached during saccades; drifts back to Listing's plane outlasted the saccades. Torsion of the extorting eye was larger than that of the intorting eye, producing a transient positive cyclovergence. Torsion and cyclovergence evoked by vertical saccades were also stereotyped in each eye, but showed idiosyncratic differences among subjects. We conclude that Listing's law is violated during saccades. Transient saccade-evoked torsion might reflect properties of the three-dimensional velocity-to-position integrator and/or the ocular plant.},

abstract = {One-half of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons switch from single-spike activity to burst-firing mode according to membrane potential. In an earlier study, the ionic mechanisms of the bursting mode were studied but the ionic currents underlying single-spike activity were not determined. The single-spike mode of activity of STN neurons recorded from acute slices in the current clamp mode is TTX-sensitive but is not abolished by antagonists of ionotropic glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors, blockers of calcium currents (2 mM cobalt or 40 $\mu$M nickel), or intracellular Ca2+ ions chelators. Tonic activity is characterized by a pacemaker depolarization that spontaneously brings the membrane from the peak of the afterspike hyperpolarization (AHP) to firing threshold (from −57.1 ± 0.5 mV to −42.2 ± 0.3 mV). Voltage-clamp recordings suggest that the Ni2+-sensitive, T-type Ca2+ current does not play a significant role in single-spike activity because it is totally inactivated at potentials more depolarized than −60 mV. In contrast, the TTX-sensitive,I NaP that activated at −54.4 ± 0.6 mV fulfills the conditions for underlying pacemaker depolarization because it is activated below spike threshold and is not fully inactivated in the pacemaker range. In some cases, the depolarization required to reach the threshold for I NaP activation is mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I h). This was directly confirmed by the cesium-induced shift from single-spike to burst-firing mode which was observed in some STN neurons. Therefore, a fraction ofI h which is tonically activated at rest, exerts a depolarizing influence and enables membrane potential to reach the threshold for I NaP activation, thus favoring the single-spike mode. The combined action ofI NaP and I h is responsible for the dual mode of discharge of STN neurons.},

@article{Besl1992,
abstract = {This paper describes a general-purpose, representation-independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of "shape complexity," one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For example, a given "model" shape and a sensed "data" shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.},

abstract = {The first peak of the knee adduction moment has been linked to the presence, severity, and progression of medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. The objective of this study was to evaluate toe-in gait (decreased foot progression angle from baseline through internal foot rotation) as a means to reduce the first peak of the knee adduction moment in subjects with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. Additionally, we examined whether the first peak in the knee adduction moment would cause a concomitant increase in the peak external knee flexion moment, which can eliminate reductions in the medial compartment force that result from lowering the knee adduction moment. We tested the following hypotheses: (a) toe-in gait reduces the first peak of the knee adduction moment, and (b) toe-in gait does not increase the peak external knee flexion moment. Twelve patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis first performed baseline walking trials and then toe-in gait trials at their self-selected speed on an instrumented treadmill in a motion capture laboratory. Subjects altered their foot progression angle from baseline to toe-in gait by an average of 5?? (p{\textless}0.01), which reduced the first peak of the knee adduction moment by an average of 13{\%} (p{\textless}0.01). Toe-in gait did not increase the peak external knee flexion moment (p=0.85). The reduced knee adduction moment was accompanied by a medially-shifted knee joint center and a laterally-shifted center of pressure during early stance. These results suggest that toe-in gait may be a promising non-surgical treatment for patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Current methods to reconstruct muscle contributions to joint torque usually combine electromyograms (EMGs) with cadaver-based estimates of biomechanics, but both are imperfect representations of reality. Here, we describe a new method that enables online force reconstruction in which we optimize a "virtual" representation of muscle biomechanics. We first obtain tuning curves for the five major wrist muscles from the mean rectified EMG during the hold phase of an isometric aiming task when a cursor is driven by actual force recordings. We then apply a custom, gradient-descent algorithm to determine the set of "virtual pulling vectors" that best reach the target forces when combined with the observed muscle activity. When these pulling vectors are multiplied by the rectified and low-pass-filtered (1.3 Hz) EMG of the five muscles online, the reconstructed force provides a close spatiotemporal match to the true force exerted at the wrist. In three separate experiments, we demonstrate that the technique works equally well for surface and fine-wire recordings and is sensitive to biomechanical changes elicited by a modification of the forearm posture. In all conditions tested, muscle tuning curves obtained when the task was performed with feedback of reconstructed force were similar to those obtained when the task was performed with real force feedback. This online force reconstruction technique provides new avenues to study the relationship between neural control and limb biomechanics since the "virtual biomechanics" can be systematically altered at will.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Patellofemoral (PF) pain is common among athletes and may be caused by increased subchondral bone stress as a result of increased stress in the cartilage of the femur or patella. This article presents a modeling pipeline to estimate in vivo cartilage stress in the PF joint. METHODS: The modeling pipeline uses the finite element method to calculate stresses and strains in the PF joint cartilage. Model inputs include an accurate geometrical representation of the bones and cartilage from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cartilage material properties, and an estimate of muscle forces from an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model. Validation is performed using PF joint contact area and patellar orientation measured from upright, weight-bearing MRI. Preliminary data from an active, pain-free subject illustrate the modeling pipeline to calculate cartilage stress during a static squat. RESULTS: The quasistatic finite element simulation reproduced the orientation of the patella to within 2.1 mm and predicted the PF joint contact area to within 2.3{\%}. Octahedral shear stresses were highest in the central, lateral aspect of the patella cartilage with a peak of 2.5 MPa. The corresponding stresses in the femoral cartilage reached only 2.0 MPa. However, peak hydrostatic pressures were higher within the femoral cartilage (3.5 MPa) than the patellar cartilage (2.3 MPa). CONCLUSION: The methods presented in this article offer a novel approach to calculate PF joint cartilage stress in vivo. Future efforts will use this modeling pipeline to further our knowledge of PF pain and potential rehabilitation strategies.},

abstract = {Rectus femoris transfer surgery is a common treatment for stiff knee gait in children with cerebral palsy. Unfortunately, the improvement in knee motion after surgery is inconsistent. There is great interest in understanding the causes of stiff knee gait and determining predictors of improved knee motion after surgery. This study demonstrates that it is possible to predict whether or not a patient's knee motion will improve following rectus femoris transfer surgery with greater than 80{\%} accuracy. A predictive model was developed that requires only a few preoperative gait analysis measurements, already collected as a routine part of treatment planning. Our examination of 62 patients before and after rectus femoris transfer revealed that a combination of hip power, knee power, and knee flexion velocity at toe-off correctly predicted postoperative outcome for 80{\%} of cases. With the addition of two more preoperative measurements, hip flexion and internal rotation, prediction accuracy increased to nearly 88{\%}. Other combinations of preoperative gait analysis measurements also predicted outcomes with high accuracy. These results provide insight into factors related to positive outcomes and suggest that predictive models provide a valuable tool for determining indications for rectus femoris transfer. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Finite element (FE) computational models produce quantitative predictions of the mechanical and physiological behaviour of multiple tissues simultaneously, thereby providing a means to study changes that occur through healthy ageing and disease such as osteoarthritis (OA). As a result, significant research investment has been placed in developing such models of the human knee. Previous work has highlighted that model predictions are highly sensitive to the various inputs used to build them, particularly the mathematical definition of material properties of biological tissues. The goal of this systematic review is two-fold. First, we provide a comprehensive summation and evaluation of existing linear elastic material property data for human tibiofemoral joint tissues, tabulating numerical values as a reference resource for future studies. Second, we review efforts to model tibiofemoral joint mechanical behaviour through FE modelling with particular focus on how studies have sourced tissue material properties. The last decade has seen a renaissance in material testing fuelled by development of a variety of new engineering techniques that allow the mechanical behaviour of both soft and hard tissues to be characterised at a spectrum of scales from nano- to bulk tissue level. As a result, there now exists an extremely broad range of published values for human tibiofemoral joint tissues. However, our systematic review highlights gaps and ambiguities that mean quantitative understanding of how tissue material properties alter with age and OA is limited. It is therefore currently challenging to construct FE models of the knee that are truly representative of a specific age or disease-state. Consequently, recent tibiofemoral joint FE models have been highly generic in terms of material properties even relying on non-human data from multiple species. We highlight this by critically evaluating current ability to quantitatively compare and model (1) young and old and (2) healthy and OA human tibiofemoral joints. We suggest that future research into both healthy and diseased knee function will benefit greatly from a subject- or cohort-specific approach in which FE models are constructed using material properties, medical imagery and loading data from cohorts with consistent demographics and/or disease states.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The proposition that dynamic optimization provides better estimates of muscle forces during gait than static optimization is examined by comparing a dynamic solution with two static solutions. A 23-degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model actuated by 54 Hill-type musculotendon units was used to simulate one cycle of normal gait. The dynamic problem was to find the muscle excitations which minimized metabolic energy per unit distance traveled, and which produced a repeatable gait cycle. In the dynamic problem, activation dynamics was described by a first-order differential equation. The joint moments predicted by the dynamic solution were used as input to the static problems. In each static problem, the problem was to find the muscle activations which minimized the sum of muscle activations squared, and which generated the joint moments input from the dynamic solution. In the first static problem, muscles were treated as ideal force generators; in the second, they were constrained by their force-length-velocity properties; and in both, activation dynamics was neglected. In terms of predicted muscle forces and joint contact forces, the dynamic and static solutions were remarkably similar. Also, activation dynamics and the force-length-velocity properties of muscle had little influence on the static solutions. Thus, for normal gait, if one can accurately solve the inverse dynamics problem and if one seeks only to estimate muscle forces, the use of dynamic optimization rather than static optimization is currently not justified. Scenarios in which the use of dynamic optimization is justified are suggested. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Schattauer 2016. Introduction: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine on “Methodologies, Models and Algorithms for Patients Rehabilitation”. Objectives: The objective of the proposed approach is to develop a clinical decision support system (DSS) that will help clinicians optimally plan the ACL reconstruction procedure in a patient specific manner. Methods: A full body model is developed in this study with 23 degrees of freedom and 93 muscles. The knee ligaments are modeled as non-linear spring-damper systems and a tibiofemoral contact model was utilized. The parameters of the ligaments were calibrated based on an optimization criterion. Forward dynamics were utilized during simulation for predicting the model's response to a given set of external forces, posture configuration and physiological parameters. Results: The proposed model is quantified using MRI scans and measurements of the well-known Lachman test, on several patients with a torn ACL. The clinical potential of the proposed framework is demonstrated in the context of flexion-extension, gait and jump actions. The clinician is able to modify and fine tune several parameters such as the number of bundles, insertion position on the tibia or femur and the resting length that correspond to the choices of the surgical procedure and study their effect on the biomechanical behavior of the knee. Conclusion: Computational knee models can be used to predict the effect of surgical decisions and to give insight on how different parameters can affect the stability of the knee. Special focus has to be given in proper calibration and experimental validation.},

abstract = {The development of legged robots for complex environments requires controllers that guarantee both high tracking performance and compliance with the environment. More specifically the control of the contact interaction with the environment is of crucial importance to ensure stable, robust and safe motions. In this contribution we develop an inverse-dynamics controller for floating-base robots under contact constraints that can minimize any combination of linear and quadratic costs in the contact constraints and the commands. Our main result is the exact analytical derivation of the controller. Such a result is particularly relevant for legged robots as it allows us to use torque redundancy to directly optimize contact interactions. For example, given a desired locomotion behavior, we can guarantee the minimization of contact forces to reduce slipping on difficult terrains while ensuring high tracking performance of the desired motion. The main advantages of the controller are its simplicity, computational efficiency and robustness to model inaccuracies. We present detailed experimental results on simulated humanoid and quadruped robots as well as a real quadruped robot. The experiments demonstrate that the controller can greatly improve the robustness of locomotion of the robots. 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {We propose a comprehensive model of spastic hypertonia based on clinical neurophysiology and validated using experimental data obtained from the pendulum test of the leg in 8 healthy volunteers and 15 spastic patients. This nonlinear computational model includes mechanical parameters and a stretch reflex representation involving three neural parameters: a threshold coefficient, the gain of the stretch reflex, and a time lag accounting for the reflex loop latency and the electromechanical coupling delay. Variation of the threshold coefficient alone allowed an overall reproduction of experimental data obtained from spastic and healthy subjects. We propose that this parameter could represent the supraspinal drive, supposed to be preserved in control subjects and decreased in spastic patients. No subsequent variation of the reflex gain was required to simulate spastic traces. Adjustment of the time lag influenced the duration of the swinging phase and oscillatory phenomena possibly occurring during the pendulum test. It could be related to the involvement of either short- or long-latency stretch reflex loops. With respect to current neurophysiological concepts of motor control, this modeling approach may help in understanding mechanisms underlying spastic hypertonia, and in predicting the clinical effect of antispasticity agents.},

abstract = {The menisci of the knee play an important role in joint function and our understanding of knee mechanics and tissue interactions can be enhanced through computational models of the tibio-menisco-femoral structure. Several finite element models of the knee that include meniscus-cartilage contact exist, but these models are typically limited to simplified boundary conditions. Movement simulation and musculoskeletal modeling can predict muscle forces, but are typically performed using the multibody method with simplified representation of joint structures. This study develops a subject specific computational model of the knee with menisci that can be incorporated into neuromusculoskeletal models within a multibody framework. Meniscus geometries from a 78-year-old female right cadaver knee were divided into 61 discrete elements (29 medial and 32 lateral) that were connected through 6x6 stiffness matrices. An optimization and design of experiments approach was used to determine parameters for the 6x6 stiffness matrices such that the force-displacement relationship of the meniscus matched that of a linearly elastic transversely isotropic finite element model for the same cadaver knee. Similarly, parameters for compliant contact models of tibio-menisco-femoral articulations were derived from finite element solutions. As a final step, a multibody knee model was developed and placed within a dynamic knee simulator model and the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral kinematics compared to an identically loaded cadaver knee. RMS errors between finite element displacement and multibody displacement after parameter optimization were 0.017 mm for the lateral meniscus and 0.051 mm for the medial meniscus. RMS errors between model predicted and experimental cadaver kinematics during a walk cycle were less than 11 mm translation and less than 7 degrees orientation. A small improvement in kinematics, compared to experimental measurements, was seen when the menisci were included versus a model without the menisci. With the menisci the predicted tibio-femoral contact force was significantly reduced on the lateral side (937 N peak force versus 633 N peak force), but no significant reduction was seen on the medial side.},

abstract = {Local field potential (LFP) recordings from patients with deep brain stimulation electrodes in the basal ganglia have suggested that frequency-specific activities correlate with force or effort, but previous studies have not been able to disambiguate the two. Here, we dissociated effort from actual force generated by contrasting the force generation of different fingers while recording LFP activity from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease who had undergone functional surgery. Patients were studied while on their normal dopaminergic medication. We investigated the relationship between frequency-specific oscillatory activity in the STN and voluntary flexion of either the index or little finger at different effort levels. At each tested effort level (10{\%}, 25{\%}, and 40{\%} of the maximal voluntary contraction force of each individual finger), the index finger generated larger force than the little finger. Movement-related suppression of beta-band power in the STN LFP was significantly modulated by effort, but not by which finger was used, suggesting that the beta suppression in the STN LFP during sustained contraction serves as a proxy for effort. The absolute force scaled with beta power suppression, but with the scaling determined by the maximal voluntary contraction force of the motor effector. Our results argue against the hypothesis that the basal ganglia are directly involved in the parameterization of force during movement and support a role of the STN in the control of motor effort to be attributed to a response.},

As a complement to experiments, finite element modelling, and statistical analysis, probabilistic analysis provides a method of characterizing the potential impact of variability in parameters on performance. This paper presents an overview of probabilistic analysis and a review of biomechanics literature utilizing probabilistic methods in structural reliability, kinematics, joint mechanics, musculoskeletal modelling, and patient-specific representations. The aim of this review paper is to demonstrate the wide range of applications of probabilistic methods and to aid researchers and clinicians in better understanding probabilistic analyses.},

abstract = {We developed a Kalman smoothing algorithm to improve estimates of joint kinematics from measured marker trajectories during motion analysis. Kalman smoothing estimates are based on complete marker trajectories. This is an improvement over other techniques, such as the global optimisation method (GOM), Kalman filtering, and local marker estimation (LME), where the estimate at each time instant is only based on part of the marker trajectories. We applied GOM, Kalman filtering, LME, and Kalman smoothing to marker trajectories from both simulated and experimental gait motion, to estimate the joint kinematics of a ten segment biomechanical model, with 21 degrees of freedom. Three simulated marker trajectories were studied: without errors, with instrumental errors, and with soft tissue artefacts (STA). Two modelling errors were studied: increased thigh length and hip centre dislocation. We calculated estimation errors from the known joint kinematics in the simulation study. Compared with other techniques, Kalman smoothing reduced the estimation errors for the joint positions, by more than 50{\%} for the simulated marker trajectories without errors and with instrumental errors. Compared with GOM, Kalman smoothing reduced the estimation errors for the joint moments by more than 35{\%}. Compared with Kalman filtering and LME, Kalman smoothing reduced the estimation errors for the joint accelerations by at least 50{\%}. Our simulation results show that the use of Kalman smoothing substantially improves the estimates of joint kinematics and kinetics compared with previously proposed techniques (GOM, Kalman filtering, and LME) for both simulated, with and without modelling errors, and experimentally measured gait motion. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigated the saccade decision process by examining activity recorded in the frontal eye field (FEF) of monkeys performing 2 separate visual search experiments in which there were errors in saccade target choice. In the first experiment, the difficulty of a singleton search task was manipulated by varying the similarity between the target and distractors; errors were made more often when the distractors were similar to the target. On catch trials in which the target was absent the monkeys occasionally made false alarm errors by shifting gaze to one of the distractors. The second experiment was a popout color visual search task in which the target and distractor colors switched unpredictably across trials. Errors occurred most frequently on the first trial after the switch and less often on subsequent trials. In both experiments, FEF neurons selected the saccade goal on error trials, not the singleton target of the search array. Although saccades were made to the same stimulus locations, presaccadic activation and the magnitude of selection differed across trial conditions. The variation in presaccadic selective activity was accounted for by the variation in saccade probability across the stimulus - response conditions, but not by variations in saccade metrics. These results suggest that FEF serves as a saccade probability map derived from the combination of bottom-up and top-down influences. Peaks on this map represent the behavioral relevance of each item in the visual field rather than just reflecting saccade preparation. This map in FEF may correspond to the theoretical salience map of many models of attention and saccade target selection.},

abstract = {Animals such as reptiles, amphibians and mammals (including humans) are mechanically extremely complex. It has been estimated that the human body has between 500 and 1400 degrees of freedom! And yet, these animals can generate an infinite variety of very precise, complicated and goal-directed movements in continuously changing and uncertain environments. Understanding how this is achieved is of great interest to both biologists and engineers.There are essentially two questions that must be addressed: (1) What type of control strategy is used to handle the large number of degrees of freedom involved? and (2) How is this strategy instantiated in the substrate of neural and musculoskeletal elements comprising the animal bodies? The first question has been studied intensively for several decades, providing strong indications that, rather than using standard feedback control based on continuous tracking of desired trajectories, animals' movements emerge from the controlled combination of pre-configured . movement primitives or . synergies. These synergies represent coordinated activity patterns over groups of muscles, and can be triggered as a whole with controlled amplitude and temporal offset. Complex movements can thus be constructed from the appropriate combination of a relatively small number of synergies, greatly simplifying the control problem.Although experimental studies on animal movements have confirmed the existence of motor synergies, and their utility has been demonstrated in the control of fairly complex robots, their neural basis remains poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce a simple but plausible and general neural model for motor synergies based on the principle that these functional modules reflect the structural modularity of the underlying physical system. Using this model, we show that a small set of synergies selected through a redundancy-reduction principle can generate a rich motor repertoire in a model two-jointed arm system. We investigate the synergies generated by this model systematically with respect to various parameters, and compare them to those observed in experiments. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knee joint sagittal plane forces are a proposed mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament injury during sport movements such as sidestep cutting. Ligament force magnitudes for these movements however, remain unknown. The need to examine injury-causing events suggests elucidation via model-based investigations is possible. Using this approach, the current study determined whether sagittal plane knee loading during sidestep cutting could in isolation injure the anterior cruciate ligament. METHODS: Experiments were performed on subject-specific forward dynamic musculoskeletal models, generated from data obtained from 10 male and 10 female athletes. Models were optimized to simulate subject-specific cutting movements. Random perturbations (n=5000) were applied to initial contact conditions and quadriceps/hamstrings activation levels to simulate their effect on peak 3D knee loads. Injury via the sagittal plane mechanism was based on the criterion of an anterior drawer force greater than 2000 N. FINDINGS: Realistic neuromuscular perturbations produced significant increases in external knee anterior force and valgus and internal rotation moments. Peak anterior drawer force never exceeded 2000 N in any model, and thus failed to cause anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Valgus loads reached values that were high enough to rupture the ligament, occurring more frequently in females than in males. INTERPRETATION: Sagittal plane knee joint forces cannot rupture the anterior cruciate ligament during sidestep cutting. The interaction between muscle and joint mechanics and external ground reaction forces in this plane, places a ceiling on ligament loads. Valgus loading is a more likely injury mechanism, especially in females. Modifying sagittal plane biomechanics will thus unlikely contribute to the prevention of anterior cruciate ligament injuries.},

We first introduce a residual elimination algorithm (REA) to compute pelvis and low back kinematic trajectories that ensure consistency between whole-body dynamics and measured ground reactions. We then use a computed muscle control (CMC) algorithm to vary muscle excitations to track experimental joint kinematics within a forward dynamic simulation. CMC explicitly accounts for delays in muscle force production resulting from activation and contraction dynamics while using a general static optimization framework to resolve muscle redundancy. CMC was used to compute muscle excitation patterns that drove a 21-degrees-of-freedom, 92 muscle model to track experimental gait data of 10 healthy young adults. Simulated joint kinematics closely tracked experimental quantities (mean root-mean-squared errors generally less than 1 degrees), and the time histories of muscle activations were similar to electromyographic recordings. A simulation of a half-cycle of gait could be generated using approximately 30 min of computer processing time. The speed and accuracy of REA and CMC make it practical to generate subject-specific simulations of gait.},

abstract = {This work explores the involvement of spinal circuits in the generation of parkinsonian rigidity and related motor dysfunction. A computer model of spinal proprioceptive input processing, derived from previous work on spasticity modeling, was adapted to the simulation of parkinsonian rigidity. Model parameters were varied to generate simulations reproducing experimental data obtained using the pendulum test of the leg in 10 parkinsonian patients and 3 healthy subjects. Convenient reproductions of experimental traces in rigidity were obtained by the combination of a low reflex gain and a decrease in reflex threshold. These findings are consistent with studies reporting an increase of spinal interneuron excitability and proprioception deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, as the threshold parameter was much lowered, our model generated typical features of parkinsonian resting tremor, endorsing the hypothesis of a participation of a spinal oscillator in this disorder. Finally, tuning the reflex gain during simulations of rigidity resulted in the generation of active movement, opening some hypotheses on pathophysiology of motor dysfunction in PD, and notably, of akinesia. More generally, this work accredits the hypothesis of the involvement of an aperiodic, altered supra-spinal motor drive in PD, resulting in spinal dysfunction, through specific descending motor pathways. This may lead to a search for new (spinal) pharmacological targets in PD. It emphasizes further the value of computer modeling in understanding motor control in health and disease.},

abstract = {This study examined the influence of a 6-week gait retraining program on the knee adduction moment (KAM) and knee pain and function. Ten subjects with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis and self-reported knee pain participated in weekly gait retraining sessions over 6 weeks. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores and a 10-point visual-analog pain scale score were measured at baseline, post-training (end of 6 weeks), and 1 month after training ended. Gait retraining reduced the first peak KAM by 20{\%} (p {\textless} 0.01) post-training as a result of a 7° decrease in foot progression angle (i.e., increased internal foot rotation), compared to baseline (p {\textless} 0.01). WOMAC pain and function scores were improved at post-training by 29{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05) and visual-analog pain scale scores improved by two points (p {\textless} 0.05). Changes in WOMAC pain and function were approximately 75{\%} larger than the expected placebo effect (p {\textless} 0.05). Changes in KAM, foot progression angle, WOMAC pain and function, and visual-analog pain score were retained 1 month after the end of the 6-week training period (p {\textless} 0.05). These results show that a 6-week gait retraining program can reduce the KAM and improve symptoms for individuals with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis and knee pain.},

Musculoskeletal models have historically been created based on data derived in anatomical and biomechanical studies of cadaveric specimens. MRI offers an abundance of novel methods for acquisition of data from living subjects and is revolutionizing the field of musculoskeletal modeling. The need to create accurate, individualized models of the musculoskeletal system is driving advances in MRI techniques including static imaging, dynamic imaging, diffusion imaging, body imaging, pulse-sequence design, and coil design. These techniques apply to imaging musculoskeletal anatomy, muscle architecture, joint motions, muscle moment arms, and muscle tissue deformations.

In the present paper we give a first impression of how such an application may look like for the driven gait orthosis Lokomat. With a preliminary study we furthermore show, that such applications not only lead to higher motivation during training but also increase the activity of the patient.

Using a experiment protocol where subjects were asked to transit between control states with equal end-effector force but different stiffness requirements, we observed that (1) some subjects used the same muscle synergy for both conditions by maintaining the same synergy throughout the transition, and (2) other subjects used two different muscle synergies to execute two conditions by transiting from one synergy to another rapidly. We hypothesize that humans typically try to use the same muscle synergy to execute two tasks when it is possible to optimize on the simplicity and speed over energy. This is a different control strategy from the way robots have been controlled in the past, and it provides a new direction in controlling an anthropomorphic robotic hand.},

abstract = {Computational efficiency of numerical simulations is a key issue in multibody system (MBS) dynamics, and parallel computing is one of the most promising approaches to increase the computational efficiency of MBS dynamic simulations. The present work evaluates two non-intrusive parallelization techniques for multibody system dynamics: parallel sparse linear equation solvers and OpenMP. Both techniques can be applied to existing simulation software with minimal changes in the code structure; this is a major advantage over MPI (Message Passing Interface), the de facto standard parallelization method in multibody dynamics. Both techniques have been applied to parallelize a starting sequential implementation of a global index-3 augmented Lagrangian formulation combined with the trapezoidal rule as numerical integrator, in order to solve the forward dynamics of a variable number of loops four-bar mechanism. This starting implementation represented a highly optimized code, where the overhead of parallelization would represent a considerable part of the total amount of elapsed time in calculations. Several multi-threaded solvers have been added to the original software. In addition, parallelizable regions of the code have been detected and multi-threaded via OpenMP directives. Numerical experiments have been performed to measure the efficiency of the parallelized code as a function of problem size and matrix filling ratio. Results show that the best parallel solver (Pardiso) performs better than the best sequential solver (CHOLMOD) for multibody problems of large and medium sizes leading to matrix fillings above 10 non-zeros per variable. OpenMP also proved to be advantageous even for problems of small sizes, in despite of the small percentage of parallelizable workload with respect to the total burden of the execution of the code. Both techniques delivered speedups above 70{\%} of the maximum theoretical values for a wide range of multibody problems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by ASME.},

The purpose of this article is to provide a perspective on how data science methods can be incorporated into our field to advance our understanding of gait biomechanics and improve treatment planning procedures. We provide examples of how data science approaches have been applied to biomechanical data. We then discuss the challenges that remain for effectively using data science approaches in clinical gait analysis and gait biomechanics research, including the need for new tools, better infrastructure and incentives for sharing data, and education across the disciplines of biomechanics and data science. By addressing these challenges, we can revolutionize treatment planning and biomechanics research by capitalizing on the wealth of knowledge gained by gait researchers over the past decades and the vast, but often siloed, data that are collected in clinical and research laboratories around the world.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional model of the human body is used to simulate a maximal vertical jump. The body is modeled as a 10-segment, 23 degree-of-freedom (dof), mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. Six generalized coordinates describe the position and orientation of the pelvis relative to the ground; the remaining nine segments branch in an open chain from the pelvis. The head, arms, and torso (HAT) are modeled as a single rigid body. The HAT articulates with the pelvis via a 3 dof ball-and-socket joint. Each hip is modeled as a 3 dof ball-and-socket joint, and each knee is modeled as a 1 dof hinge joint. Each foot is represented by a hindfoot and toes segment. The hindfoot articulates with the shank via a 2 dof universal joint, and the toes articulate with the hindfoot via a 1 dof hinge joint. Interaction of the feet with the ground is modeled using a series of spring-damper units placed under the sole of each foot. The path of each muscle is represented by either a series of straight lines or a combination of straight lines and space curves. Each actuator is modeled as a three-element, Hill-type muscle in series with tendon. A first-order process is assumed to model muscle excitation-contraction dynamics. Dynamic optimization theory is used to calculate the pattern of muscle excitations that produces a maximal vertical jump. Quantitative comparisons between model and experiment indicate that the model reproduces the kinematic, kinetic, and muscle-coordination patterns evident when humans jump to their maximum achievable heights.},

abstract = {Technological developments in the last decade have enabled the integration of sensors and actuators into wearable devices for gait interventions to slow the progression of knee osteoarthritis. Wearable haptic gait retraining is one area which has seen promising results for informing modifications of gait parameters for reducing knee adduction moments (KAM) during walking. Two gait parameters which can be easily adjusted to influence KAM include foot progression angle (FPA) and step width (SW). The purpose of this study was to: (1) determine whether a custom haptic ankle bracelet using binary vibrotactile and tactile apparent movement feedback could retrain ten healthy subjects to walk with a modified FPA and SW within a short training session with 80{\%} accuracy; and (2) whether there was a difference between the number of steps required to complete the retraining task based on the two feedback schemes being tested. Retraining multiple gait parameters using a single device was a novel aspect of this work and we found that nine out of ten subjects were able to retrain their gait using the ankle bracelet in both feedback schemes to within 2° and 39 mm of target FPA and SW respectively. We also found no difference in the number steps required for completion between the two schemes (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Future research will investigate the device performance with patients with knee osteoarthritis and the effective change in KAM by modifying a combination of FPA and SW.},

abstract = {To execute a movement, the CNS must appropriately select and activate the set of muscles that will produce the desired movement. This problem is particularly difficult because a variety of muscle subsets can usually be used to produce the same joint motion. The motor system is therefore faced with a motor redundancy problem that must be resolved to produce the movement. In this paper, we present a model of muscle recruitment in the wrist step-tracking task. Muscle activation levels for five muscles are selected so as to satisfy task constraints (moving to the designated target) while also minimizing a measure of the total effort in producing the movement. Imposing these constraints yields muscle activation patterns qualitatively similar to those observed experimentally. In particular, the model reproduces the observed cosine-like recruitment of muscles as a function of movement direction and also appropriately predicts that certain muscles will be recruited most strongly in movement directions that differ significantly from their direction of action. These results suggest that the observed recruitment behavior may not be an explicit strategy employed by the nervous system, but instead may result from a process of movement optimization.},

It turned out that the unique selectivity of HOXD1 for F-/H2PO4- is ascribed to its ability of deprotonating the hydroxy group of host sensor. Optical spectra of neutral and deprotonated sensors were simulated using TD-DFT method. It was found that intermolecular proton transfer is responsible for the colorimetric and fluorescent signaling of chemosensor for F-/H2PO4-. Seven derivatives of HOXD1 have been designed. All the mono-electron-donating (-CH3, -OCH3, and -N(CH3)2) substituted derivatives are expected to be promising candidates for ratiometric fluorescent F-/H2PO4- chemosensors as well as chromogenic chemosensors, while para-N(CH3)2 substituted derivative can serve as chromogenic F-/H2PO4- chemosensor only. Furthermore, the mono-electron-withdrawing (-CN and -COCH3) derivatives are promising electron transport and luminescent materials for OLEDs as well.},

abstract = {We investigated how the brain selects the targets for eye movements, a process in which the outcome of visual processing is converted into guided action. Macaque monkeys were trained to make a saccade to fixate a salient target presented either alone or with multiple distracters during visual search. Neural activity was recorded in the frontal eye field, a cortical area at the interface of visual processing and eye movement production. Neurons discharging after stimulus presentation and before saccade initiation were analyzed. The initial visual response of frontal eye field neurons was modulated by the presence of multiple stimuli and by whether a saccade was going to be produced, but the initial visual response did not discriminate the target of the search array from the distracters. In the latent period before saccade initiation, the activity of most visually responsive cells evolved to signal the location of the target. Target selection occurred through suppression of distracter evoked activity contingent on the location of the target relative to the receptive field. The evolution of a signal specifying the location of the salient target could be dissociated from saccade initiation in some cells and could occur even when fixation was maintained. Neural activity in the frontal eye fields may participate in or be the product of the decision process guiding eye movements.},

abstract = {1. The aim of this work was to compare the ability of several mathematical models to predict the firing characteristics of muscle spindle primary afferents recorded chronically during normal stepping in cats. 2. Ensemble firing profiles of nine hamstring spindle primary (presumed group Ia) afferents were compiled from stored data from 132 step cycles. Three sets of profiles corresponding to slow, medium and fast steps were generated by averaging groups of step cycles aligned to peak muscle length in each cycle. 3. Five models obtained from the literature were compared. Each of these models was used to predict the spindle firing profiles from the averaged muscle length signals. The models were also used in the reverse direction, namely to predict muscle length from the firing profiles. A sixth model incorporating some key aspects of the other models was also included in the comparisons. 4. Five of the models predicted spindle firing well, with root mean square (r.m.s.) errors lower than 14 {\%} of the modulation depth of the target profiles. The key variable in achieving good predictions was muscle velocity, the best fits being obtained with power-law functions of velocity, with an exponent of 0.5 or 0.6 (i.e. spindle firing rate is approximately proportional to the square root of muscle velocity). The fits were slightly improved by adding small components of EMG signal to mimic fusimotor action linked to muscle activation. The modest relative size of EMG-linked fusimotor action may be related to the fact that hamstring muscles are not strongly recruited in stepping. 5. Length was predicted very accurately from firing profiles with the inverse of the above models, indicating that the nervous system could in principle process spindle firing in a relatively simple way to give accurate information on muscle length. 6. The responses of the models to standard ramp-and-hold displacements at 10 mm s-1 were also studied (i.e. velocities that were an order of magnitude lower than that during stepping). In these cases components of spindle primary response related to length as well as velocity were needed for good fits. Because these length-related components detracted from rather than improved predictions of the step cycle data, an attenuation of length dependence at high muscle velocities emerged as a possibility. 7. We conclude that in this study we have identified models and parameters that may be used to predict spindle afferent firing from the time course of muscle length in the cat step cycle.},

The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of a non-linear stiffness model for the manipulators with passive joints, a relevant numerical technique for computing the Cartesian stiffness and stability criteria for configurations of the kinematic chains. Within the developed technique, the manipulator elements are presented as pseudo-rigid bodies separated by multidimensional virtual springs and perfect passive joints. Simulation examples are presented that deal with parallel manipulators of the Ortholide family and demonstrate the ability of the developed methodology to describe non-linear behavior of the manipulator structure such as a sudden change of the elastic instability properties (buckling). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This yields a generic locomotion control method that supports a variety of bipedal creatures. All actuation forces are the result of 3D simulated muscles, and a model of neural delay is included for all feedback paths. As a result, our controllers generate torque patterns that incorporate biomechanical constraints. The synthesized controllers find different gaits based on target speed, can cope with uneven terrain and external perturbations, and can steer to target directions.},

abstract = {Multiplicative gain control is a vital component of many theoretical analyses of neural computations, conferring the ability to scale neuronal firing rate in response to synaptic inputs. Many theories of gain control in single cells have used precisely balanced noisy inputs. Such noisy inputs can degrade signal processing. We demonstrate a deterministic method for the control of gain without the use of noise. We show that a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), arising from active dendritic spike backpropagation, leads to a multiplicative increase in gain. Reduction of DAP amplitude by dendritic inhibition dilutes the multiplicative effect, allowing for divisive scaling of the firing rate. In contrast, somatic inhibition acts in a subtractive manner, allowing spatially distinct inhibitory inputs to perform distinct computations. The simplicity of this mechanism and the ubiquity of its elementary components suggest that many cell types have the potential to display a dendritic division of neuronal output.},

@article{Riener1998,
abstract = {To control movements aided by functional electrical stimulation (FES) in paraplegic patients, stimulation of the paralyzed lower limbs might be adjusted in response to voluntary upper body effort. Recently, Donaldson and Yu proposed a theoretical approach, called "control by handle reactions of leg muscle stimulation" (CHRELMS), in which stimulation of the lower limbs depends on upper body effort, i.e., body posture and recorded hand reactions, and is aimed to minimize arm forces during standing up and standing. An alternative strategy is presented in this paper, which accounts for voluntary upper body effort as well, but does not require estimation of hand reactions. The objective of this study is to test both strategies by applying them to a generic two-dimensional (2-D) neuromusculoskeletal model. The model takes into account the major properties of muscle and segmental dynamics during FES-supported standing-up movements of a paraplegic patient. In comparison to standing up without FES-support, both closed-loop strategies yield satisfying standing-up movements although no reference information (e.g., a desired trajectory) is required. Arm forces can be significantly reduced. Using the model to optimize the controller, time-consuming and strenuous trial-and-error experimentation could be avoided. However, final experimental studies are planned to verify the presented strategies.},

abstract = {We developed a physiologically realistic mathematical model of the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) whose elements correspond to anatomical features of the biological receptor. The mechanical interactions of these elements enable it to capture all salient aspects of GTO afferent behavior reported in the literature. The model accurately describes the GTO's static and dynamic responses to activation of single motor units whose muscle fibers insert into the GTO, including the different static and dynamic sensitivities that exist for different types of muscle fibers (S, FR, and FF). Furthermore, it captures the phenomena of self- and cross-adaptation wherein the GTO dynamic response during motor unit activation is reduced by prior activation of the same or a different motor unit, respectively. The model demonstrates various degrees of nonlinear summation of GTO responses resulting from simultaneous activation of multiple motor units. Similarly to the biological GTO, the model suggests that the activation of every additional motor unit to already active motor units that influence the receptor will have a progressively weaker incremental effect on the GTO afferent activity. Finally, the proportional relationship between the cross-adaptation and summation recorded for various pairs of motor units was captured by the model, but only by incorporating a particular type of occlusion between multiple transduction regions that were previously suggested. This occlusion mechanism is consistent with the anatomy of the afferent innervation and its arrangement with respect to the collagen strands inserting into the GTO.},

abstract = {Body segment inertial parameters (BSIPs) are important data in biomechanics. They are usually estimated from predictive equations reported in the literature. However, most of the predictive equations are ambiguously applicable in the conventional 3D segment coordinate systems (SCSs). Also, the predictive equations reported in the literature all include two assumptions: the centre of mass and the proximal and distal endpoints are assumed to be aligned, and the inertia tensor is assumed to be principal in the segment axes. These predictive equations, restraining both position of the centre of mass and orientation of the principal axes of inertia, become restrictive when computing 3D inverse dynamics, when analyzing the influence of BSIP estimations on joint forces and moments and when evaluating personalized 3D BSIPs obtained from medical imaging. In the current study, the extensive data from McConville et al. (1980. Anthropometric relationships of body and body segment moments of inertia. AFAMRL-TR-80-119, Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio) and from Young et al. (1983. Anthropometric and mass distribution characteristics of the adults female. Technical Report AFAMRL-TR-80-119, FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute, Oklaoma City, Oklaoma) are adjusted in order to correspond to joint centres and to conventional segment axes. In this way, scaling equations are obtained for both males and females that provide BSIPs which are directly applicable in the conventional SCSs and do not restrain the position of the centre of mass and the orientation of the principal axes. These adjusted scaling equations may be useful for researchers who wish to use appropriate 3D BSIPs for posture and movement analysis.},

abstract = {To synthesize whole-body behaviors interactively, multiple behavioral primitives need to be simultaneously controlled, including those that guarantee that the constraints imposed by the robot's structure and the external environment are satisfied. Behavioral primitives are entities for the control of various movement criteria, e.g. primitives describing the behavior of the center of gravity, the behaviors of the hands, legs, and head, the body attitude and posture, the constrained body parts such as joint-limits and contacts, etc. By aggregating multiple primitives, we synthesize whole-body behaviors. For safety and for efficient control, we establish a control hierarchy among behavioral primitives, which is exploited to establish control priorities among the different control categories, i.e. constraints, operational tasks, and postures. Constraints should always be guaranteed, while operational tasks should be accomplished without violating the acting constraints, and the posture should control the residual movement redundancy. In this paper, we will present a multi-level hierarchical control structure that allows the establishment of general priorities among behavioral primitives, and we will describe compliant control strategies for efficient control under contact interactions.},

abstract = {The superior colliculus in the monkey contains a topographically organized representation of the target in its upper layers and saccade-related activity in its deeper layers. Since collicular movement fields are quite large, a considerable region of the colliculus is active whenever a saccade is made. We have modelled the collicular role in saccade generation based on the idea, proposed earlier in the literature, that each movement cell causes a movement tendency in the direction of the external world point which it represents in the collicular map. The model is organized as follows:(1)An anisotropic logarithmic mapping transforms retinal coordinates into collicular coordinates.(2)A two-dimensional Gaussian function describes the spatial extent of the movement-related activity in the deeper layers.(3)An efferent mapping function specifies how the direction and the size of the movement contribution of each colliculus neuron depends on its location and its firing rate.(4)The total saccade is the vector sum of the individual cell contributions. This very simple model (seven fixed parameters) has been used to simulate metrical properties of saccades:(a)in response to visual targets;(b)in response to electrical stimulation in one colliculus, and(c)after a colliculus lesion. Model performance appears to be remarkably realistic but cannot account for some border effects and responses to double stimulation. Suggestions on how the model can be improved and extended will be presented.},

In this study, the method for scaling musculotendon parameters published by Winby et al. (2008), J. Biomech. 41, 1682-1688, has been reformulated, generalized and applied to two cases of practical interest: 1) the adjustment of muscle parameters in the entire lower limb following linear scaling of a generic model and 2) their estimation "from scratch" in a subject specific model of the hip joint created from medical images. In the first case, the procedure maintained the muscles' operating range between models with mean errors below 2.3{\%} of the reference model normalized fiber length value. In the second case, a subject specific model of the hip joint was created using segmented bone geometries and muscle volumes publicly available for a cadaveric specimen from the Living Human Digital Library (LHDL). Estimated optimal fiber lengths were found to be consistent with those of a previously published dataset for all 27 considered muscle bundles except gracilis. However, computed tendon slack lengths differed from tendon lengths measured in the LHDL cadaver, suggesting that tendon slack length should be determined via optimization in subject-specific applications. Overall, the presented methodology could adjust the parameters of a scaled model and enabled the estimation of muscle parameters in newly created subject specific models.

abstract = {Kinetic analysis of walking requires joint kinematics and ground reaction force (GRF) measurement, which are typically obtained from a force plate. GRF is difficult to measure in certain cases such as slope walking, stair climbing, and track running. Nevertheless, estimating GRF continues to be of great interest for simulating human walking. The purpose of the study was to develop reaction force models placed on the sole of the foot to estimate full GRF when only joint kinematics are provided (Type-I), and to estimate ground contact shear forces when both joint kinematics and foot pressure are provided (Type-II and Type-II-val). The GRF estimation models were attached to a commercial full body skeletal model using the AnyBody Modeling System, which has an inverse dynamics-based optimization solver. The anterior-posterior shear force and medial-lateral shear force could be estimated with approximate accuracies of 6{\%} BW and 2{\%} BW in all three methods, respectively. Vertical force could be estimated in the Type-I model with an accuracy of 13.75{\%} BW. The accuracy of the force estimation was the highest during the mid-single-stance period with an average RMS for errors of 3.10{\%} BW, 1.48{\%} BW, and 7.48{\%} BW for anterior-posterior force, medial-lateral force, and vertical force, respectively. The proposed GRF estimation models could predict full and partial GRF with high accuracy. The design of the contact elements of the proposed model should make it applicable to various activities where installation of a force measurement system is difficult, including track running and treadmill walking. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {When the hand is displaced from an equilibrium position, the muscles generate elastic forces to restore the original posture. In a previous study, Mussa-Ivaldi et al. (1985) have measured and characterized the field of elastic forces associated with hand posture in the horizontal plane. Hand stiffness which describes the relation between force and displacement vectors in the vicinity of equilibrium position was measured and graphically represented by an ellipse, characterized by its size, shape and orientation. The results indicated that the shape and orientation of the stiffness ellipse are strongly dependent on arm configuration. At any given hand position, however, the values of these parameters were found to remain invariant among subjects and over time. In this study we investigate the underlying causes for the observed spatial pattern of variation of the hand stiffness ellipse. Mathematically analyzing the relation between hand and joint stiffness matrices, we found that in order to produce the observed spatial variations of the stiffness ellipse, the shoulder stiffness must covary in the workspace with the stiffness component provided by the two-joint muscles. This condition was found to be satisfied by the measured joint stiffness components. Using anatomical data and considering the effects that muscle cross-sections and changes in muscle moment arms have on the joint stiffness matrix, we found that these anatomical factors are not sufficient to account for the observed pattern of variation of joint stiffness in the workspace. To examine whether the coupling between shoulder and two-joint stiffnesses results from the coactivation of muscles contributing to these stiffnesses, EMG signals were recorded from shoulder, elbow and two-joint muscles. Our results indicated that, while some muscle coactivation may indeed exist, it can be found for only some of the muscles and in only part of the workspace.},

abstract = {Understanding the basis of human movement and reproducing it in robotic environments is a compelling challenge that has engaged a multidisciplinary audience. In addressing this challenge, an important initial step involves reconstructing motion from experimental motion capture data. To this end we propose a new algorithm to reconstruct human motion from motion capture data through direct control of captured marker trajectories. This algorithm is based on a task/posture decomposition and prioritized control approach. This approach ensures smooth tracking of desired marker trajectories as well as the extraction of joint angles in real-time without the need for inverse kinematics. It also provides flexibility over traditional inverse kinematic approaches. Our algorithm was validated on a sequence of tai chi motions. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the direct marker control approach for motion reconstruction from experimental marker data.},

abstract = {Compared to complex structural Huxley-type models, Hill-type models phenomenologically describe muscle contraction using only few state variables. The Hill-type models dominate in the ever expanding field of musculoskeletal simulations for simplicity and low computational cost. Reasonable parameters are required to gain insight into mechanics of movement. The two most common Hill-type muscle models used contain three components. The series elastic component is connected in series to the contractile component. A parallel elastic component is either connected in parallel to both the contractile and the series elastic component (model [CC+SEC]), or is connected in parallel only with the contractile component (model [CC]). As soon as at least one of the components exhibits substantial nonlinearities, as, e.g., the contractile component by the ability to turn on and off, the two models are mechanically different. We tested which model ([CC+SEC] or [CC]) represents the cat soleus better. Ramp experiments consisting of an isometric and an isokinetic part were performed with an in situ cat soleus preparation using supramaximal nerve stimulation. Hill-type models containing force-length and force-velocity relationship, excitation-contraction coupling and series and parallel elastic force-elongation relations were fitted to the data. To test which model might represent the muscle better, the obtained parameters were compared with experimentally determined parameters. Determined in situations with negligible passive force, the force-velocity relation and the series elastic component relation are independent of the chosen model. In contrast to model [CC+SEC], these relations predicted by model [CC] were in accordance with experimental relations. In conclusion model [CC] seemed to better represent the cat soleus contraction dynamics and should be preferred in the nonlinear regression of muscle parameters and in musculoskeletal modeling.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on a sensory-motor control mechanism in human reaching movements from the perspective of robotics. By formulating a musculo-skeletal redundant system which takes into account a nonlinear muscle property and performing numerical simulations, we suggest that the human-like reaching movements can be realized by using only simple task-space feedback scheme together with the internal force effect coming from nonlinear property of muscles without any complex mathematical computation such as an inverse dynamics or some optimal trajectory derivation. Firstly, we introduce both kinematics and dynamics of a three-link serial manipulator with six monoarticular muscles and three biarticular muscles model whose movements are limited within a horizontal plane. Secondly, the nonlinear muscle property coming from a physiological study based on Hill's muscle model, is taken into consideration. This nonlinearity makes it possible to modulate the damping effect in joint-space by considering the internal force generated by the redundant muscles. By utilizing this feature, the end-point converges to the desired point using only simple task-space feedback control scheme, even thought the system owns both the joint and muscle redundancies. Finally, we illustrate numerical simulations to show the effectiveness of the control scheme, and suggest one of the direction to study brain-motor control mechanism of human movements},

abstract = {Artificial meniscal implants may replace severely injured meniscus and restore the normal functionality of the knee joint. Implant material stiffness and shape influence the longevity of implantations. This study, using 3D finite element analysis, aimed to evaluate the effects of material stiffness variations of anatomically shaped artificial meniscal implant in the knee joint. Finite element simulations were conducted on five different cases including intact knee, medial meniscectomized knee, and the knee joint with the meniscal implant with three distinct material stiffness. Cartilage contact pressures, compression stresses, shear stresses, and implant kinematics (medial-lateral and posterior-anterior displacement) were evaluated for an axial compressive load of 1150 N at full extension. Compared to the meniscectomized knee, the knee joint with the meniscal implant induced lower peak cartilage contact pressure and reduced the cartilage regions loaded with contact pressures greater than the peak cartilage contact pressure induced by the intact knee. Results of the current study also demonstrate that cartilage contact pressures and implant displacement are sensitive to the implant material stiffness. The meniscal implant with a stiffness of 11 MPa restores the intact knee contact mechanics, thereby reducing the risk of physiological damage to the articular cartilage. The menisci play a crucial role in the knee, by stabilizing the joint and disseminating forces across the articulat-ing surfaces 1 . Consequently, the upkeep of the native intact menisci is vital for healthy functioning of the knee. Meniscal tears are the most widely known knee injuries, with a rate of meniscus related injuries leading to menis-cectomy (partial or total removal of meniscus) of 61 per 100,000 populace for every year 2 . The meniscal tears observed in acute knee injuries cause hyperextension or hyperflexion of the knee in younger patients or act as a risk factor for degeneration in the elderly. Medial meniscal tears occur more often than lateral meniscus tears, at a quantitative relation of approximately 2:1 3 . It is understood that the total meniscectomy prompts progressive articular cartilage wear following a couple of years after surgery. The key fact behind this is the alteration in the global biomechanics of the knee and thereby to increase the articular instability, leading to a progressive and degenerative arthroscopic pathology 4, 5 . The patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) might be treated by meniscal allograft transplantation (i.e. supplanting of the local tissue with a benefactor meniscus) to alleviate pain and restore knee function 6 . Meniscal allografts were seen to shrivel and experience collagen remodeling upon transplantation 7, 8 , which affects the mechanical strength and may lead to allograft tears, articular instability, and degenerative damage. Moreover, issues con-cerning the provision and size of allograft, the risk of disease transfer, rejection, infection, and high expenses 7, 8 have driven the need for alternate treatment options. Recently, studies have shown that a functional synthetic full meniscal implant could conceivably overcome the deficiencies of meniscus allograft transplantation 9–12 . The improved designs of meniscal implants were extensively tested in the animal models, leading to severe damage to the articular cartilage caused by large deformation of the meniscal implant and wear-particle deposi-tion 13, 14 . A synthetic implant design resembling the native meniscus as close as possible may provide a successful},

abstract = {People suffering from locomotor impairment find turning manoeuvres more challenging than straight-ahead walking. Turning manoeuvres are estimated to comprise a substantial proportion of steps taken daily, yet research has predominantly focused on straight-line walking, meaning that the basic kinetic, kinematic and foot pressure adaptations required for turning are not as well understood. We investigated how healthy subjects adapt their locomotion patterns to accommodate walking along a gently curved trajectory (radius 2.75 m). Twenty healthy adult participants performed walking tasks at self-selected speeds along straight and curved pathways. For the first time for this mode of turning, plantar pressures were recorded using insole foot pressure sensors while participants' movements were simultaneously tracked using marker-based 3D motion capture. During the steady-state strides at the apex of the turn, the mean operating point of the inside ankle shifted by 1 degree towards dorsiflexion and that for the outside ankle shifted towards plantarflexion. The largest change in relative joint angle range was an increase in hip rotation in the inside leg ({\textgreater}60{\%}). In addition, the inside foot was subject to a prolonged stance phase and a 10{\%} increase in vertical force in the posteromedial section of the foot compared to straight-line walking. Most of the mechanical change required was therefore generated by the inside leg with hip rotation being a major driver of the gentle turn. This study provides new insight into healthy gait during gentle turns and may help us to understand the mechanics behind some forms of impairment.},

abstract = {A linear relation between surface electromyogram (EMG) amplitude and muscle force is often assumed and used to estimate the contributions of selected muscles to various tasks. In the presence of muscle fatigue, however, changes in the properties of muscle fibre action potentials and motor unit twitch forces can alter the relation between surface EMG amplitude and force. A novel integrative model of motor neuron control and the generation of muscle fibre action potentials was used to simulate surface EMG signals and muscle force during three fatigue protocols. The change in the simulated relation between surface EMG amplitude and force depended on both the level of fatigue and the details of the fatiguing contraction. In general, surface EMG amplitude overestimated muscle force when fatigue was present. For example, surface EMG amplitudes corresponding to 60 per cent of the amplitude obtained at maximal force without fatigue corresponded to forces in the range 10-40{\%} of the maximal force across three representative fatigue protocols. The results indicate that the surface EMG amplitude cannot be used to predict either the level of muscle activation or the magnitude of muscle force when the muscle exhibits any fatigue.},

abstract = {If exercises are performed to increase muscle strength on one side of the body, voluntary strength can increase on the contralateral side. This effect, termed the contralateral strength training effect, is usually measured in homologous muscles. Although known for over a century, most studies have not been designed well enough to show a definitive transfer of strength that could not be explained by factors such as familiarity with the testing. However, an updated meta-analysis of 16 properly controlled studies (range 15-48 training sessions) shows that the size of the contralateral strength training effect is approximately 8{\%} of initial strength or about half the increase in strength of the trained side. This estimate is similar to results of a large, randomized controlled study of training for the elbow flexors (contralateral effect of 7{\%} initial strength or one-quarter of the effect on the trained side). This is likely to reflect increased motoneuron output rather than muscular adaptations, although most methods are insufficiently sensitive to detect small muscle contributions. Two classes of central mechanism are identified. One involves a "spillover" to the control system for the contralateral limb, and the other involves adaptations in the control system for the trained limb that can be accessed by the untrained limb. Cortical, subcortical and spinal levels are all likely to be involved in the "transfer," and none can be excluded with current data. Although the size of the effect is small and may not be clinically significant, study of the phenomenon provides insight into neural mechanisms associated with exercise and training.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the effects of muscle axis shifts on the performance of a vector velocity-position integrator in the CNS. Earlier models of the oculomotor plant assumed that the muscle axes remained fixed relative to the head as the eye rotated into secondary and tertiary eye positions. Under this assumption, the vector integrator model generates torsional transients as the eye moves from secondary to tertiary positions of fixation. The torsional transient represents an eye movement response to a spatial mismatch between the torque axes that remain fixed in the head and the displacement plane that changes by half the angle of the change in eye orientation. When muscle axis shifts were incorporated into the model, the torque axes were closer to the displacement plane at each eye orientation throughout the trajectory, and torsional transients were reduced dramatically. Their size and dynamics were close to reported data. It was also shown that when the muscle torque axes were rotated by 50{\%} of the eye rotation, there was no torsional transient and Listing's law was perfectly obeyed. When muscle torque axes rotated {\textgreater}50{\%}, torsional transients reversed direction compared with what occurred for muscle axis shifts of {\textless}50{\%}. The model indicates that Listing's law is implemented by the oculomotor plant subject to a two-dimensional command signal that is confined to the pitch-yaw plane, having zero torsion. Saccades that bring the eye to orientations outside Listing's plane could easily be corrected by a roll pulse that resets the roll state of the velocity-position integrator to zero. This would be a simple implementation of the corrective controller suggested by Van Opstal and colleagues. The model further indicates that muscle axis shifts together with the torque orientation relationship for tissue surrounding the eye and Newton's laws of motion form a sufficient plant model to explain saccadic trajectories and periods of fixation when driven by a vector command confined to the pitch-yaw plane. This implies that the velocity-position integrator is probably realized as a subtractive feedback vector integrator and not as a quaternion-based integrator that implements kinematic transformations to orient the eye.},

abstract = {A biomechanical model of the thumb can help researchers and clinicians understand the clinical problem of how anatomical variability contributes to the variability of outcomes of surgeries to restore thumb function. We lack a realistic biomechanical model of the thumb because of the variability/uncertainty of musculoskeletal parameters, the multiple proposed kinematic descriptions and methods to solve the muscle redundancy problem, and the paucity of data to validate the model with in vivo coordination patterns and force output. We performed a multi-stage validation of a biomechanical computer model against our measurements of maximal static thumbtip force and fine-wire electromyograms (EMG) from 8 thumb muscles in each of five orthogonal directions in key and opposition pinch postures. A low-friction point-contact at the thumbtip ensured that subjects did not produce thumbtip torques during force production. The 3-D, 8-muscle biomechanical thumb model uses a 5-axis kinematic description with orthogonal and intersecting axes of rotation at the carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints. We represented the 50 musculoskeletal parameters of the model as stochastic variables based on experimental data, and ran Monte Carlo simulations in the "inverse" and "forward" directions for 5000 random instantiations of the model. Two inverse simulations (predicting the distribution of maximal static thumbtip forces and the muscle activations that maximized force) showed that: the model reproduces at most 50{\%} of the 80 EMG distributions recorded (eight muscle excitations in 5 force directions in two postures); and well-directed thumbtip forces of adequate magnitude are predicted only if accompanied by unrealistically large thumbtip torques (0.64??0.28Nm). The forward simulation (which fed the experimental distributions of EMG through random instantiations of the model) resulted in misdirected thumbtip force vectors (within 74.3??24.5?? from the desired direction) accompanied by doubly large thumbtip torques (1.32??0.95Nm). Taken together, our results suggest that the variability and uncertainty of musculoskeletal parameters and the choice of solution method are not the likely reason for the unrealistic predictions obtained. Rather, the kinematic description of the thumb we used is not representative of the transformation of net joint torques into thumbtip forces/torques in the human thumb. Future efforts should focus on validating alternative kinematic descriptions of the thumb. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In its original formulation, Listing's law referred only to eye positions during steady fixation. In recent years, however, several studies have suggested that Listing's law can be extended to the movements of the eyes, including during saccades and smooth pursuit. A major problem in deciding whether or not Listing's law is obeyed during eye movements is the influence of any spontaneous fluctuations in torsional eye position. To try to settle this question, the three-dimensional position of the eyes (around the three axes: horizontal, vertical, and torsional) was recorded with dual search coils in five normal subjects during fixations, 20 degrees saccades, blinks, and 20 degrees pursuit movements with a 20 degrees/s stimulus velocity. Eye movements across a wide range of horizontal positions were measured at different elevations of gaze during 11 min. Variability (as reflected in the standard deviation of torsional eye position) was used as a measure of the validity of Listing's law. After linear detrending single trials, each lasting 21.5 s, to remove the effects of drift over minutes, the reduction in the standard deviation of torsional position in tertiary eye positions was 54{\%} assuming a planar and 58{\%} assuming a second-order curved Listing's surface. We attributed this long-term fluctuation of the torsional signal to slippage of the coil on the eye. The remaining variability was mainly due to short-term fluctuation of eye torsion over seconds. The impact of hysteresis, associated with consecutive centrifugal-centripetal horizontal movements, on the variability of torsional eye position appeared negligible. Peak increases in the standard deviation from the fixation baseline after fitting individual Listing's planes for each trial were 348{\%} during blinks, 141{\%} during saccades, and 72{\%} during pursuit movements (median value of five subjects). In conclusion, Listing's law during blinks, saccades, and pursuit is less valid than during fixations, which raises doubts about the existence of an internal "Listing's law operator" for eye movements. Possibly, central eye velocity commands do not comply with Listing's law.},

abstract = {The morphology of 23 intracellular stained projection neurons of rat globus pallidus (GP) was studied in light microscopic preparations. The somatic size of these projection neurons was highly variable. The somatic area ranged from 78 to 353 $\mu$m2. The 23 neurons were divided into aspiny and spiny types, based on the existence of dendritic spines. Sixteen neurons were aspiny and 7 were of the spiny type. THe aspiny neurons tended to have a larger soma than the spiny neurons. Fourteen of the 23 projection neurons possessed a discoidal dendritic field w3ith the flat plane parallel to the border between the GP and the neosatriatum. All of the 14 neurons having a discoidal dendritic field were of the aspiny typeand were located throughout the GP. The other 9 neurons, which include all the 7 aspiny types, had radiating dendritic fields with a variety of shapes and were located only in the medical region of the GP. The axons of a majority (i.e. 21 of 23) of the projection neurons emitted multiple collaterals with large boutons en-passant and boutons terminaux within the GP. The main axons were traced to varying distances from their somata. Four of them were traced into the substantia nigra. Two of these 4 emitted multiple collaterals at various rostro-caudal levels in the entopeduncular nucleus, and all 4 axons had one or two collaterals in the subthalamic nucleus. This study revealed that the rat GP contains two types of projection neurons having different dendritic morphologies. The axon reconstruction indicate that the activity of both types of neurons can influence multiple basal ganglia targets, including the GP itself.},

abstract = {Leg swing in human walking has historically been viewed as a passive motion with little metabolic cost. Recent estimates of leg swing costs are equivocal, covering a range from 10 to 33 per cent of the net cost of walking. There has also been a debate as to whether the periods of double-limb support during the stance phase dominate the cost of walking. Part of this uncertainty is because of our inability to measure metabolic energy consumption in individual muscles during locomotion. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the metabolic cost of walking using a modelling approach that allowed instantaneous energy consumption rates in individual muscles to be estimated over the full gait cycle. At a typical walking speed and stride rate, leg swing represented 29 per cent of the total muscular cost. During the stance phase, the double-limb and single-limb support periods accounted for 27 and 44 per cent of the total cost, respectively. Performing step-to-step transitions, which encompasses more than just the double-support periods, represented 37 per cent of the total cost of walking. Increasing stride rate at a constant speed led to greater double-limb support costs, lower swing phase costs and no change in single-limb support costs. Together, these results provide unique insight as to how metabolic energy is expended over the human gait cycle.},

Dynamic causal modelling offers large-scale models of predictive value based on a limited or partial sampling of complex networks. Using dynamic causal modelling, we determined the network changes underlying the pathological excess of beta oscillations that characterise the Parkinsonian state. We modelled data from five patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation of more than one target. We found that connections to and from the subthalamic nucleus were strengthened and promoted beta synchrony, in the untreated compared to the treated Parkinsonian state. Dynamic causal modelling was able to replicate the effects of lesioning this nucleus and may provide a new means of directing the search for therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {The knee adduction moment (KAM) is a surrogate measure for medial compartment knee loading and is related to the progression of knee osteoarthritis. Toe-in and toe-out gait modifications typically reduce the first and second KAM peaks, respectively. We investigated whether assigning a subject-specific foot progression angle (FPA) modification reduces the peak KAM by more than assigning the same modification to everyone. To explore the effects of motor learning on muscle coordination and kinetics, we also evaluated the peak knee flexion moment and quadriceps-hamstring co-contraction during normal walking, when subjects first learned their subject-specific FPA, and following 20 min of training. Using vibrotactile feedback, we trained 20 healthy adults to toe-in and toe-out by 5° and 10° relative to their natural FPA, then identified the subject-specific FPA as the angle where each subject maximally reduced their larger KAM peak. When walking at their subject-specific FPA, 18 subjects significantly reduced their larger KAM peak; 8 by toeing-in and 10 by toeing-out. On average, subjects reduced their larger KAM peak by 18.6 ± 16.2{\%} when walking at their subject-specific FPA, which was more than the reductions achieved when all subjects toed-in by 10° (10.0 ± 17.1{\%}, p = .013) or toed-out by 10° (11.0 ± 18.3{\%}, p = .002). Quadriceps-hamstring co-contraction and the peak knee flexion moment increased when subjects first learned their subject-specific FPA, but only co-contraction returned to baseline levels following training. These findings demonstrate that subject-specific gait modifications reduce the peak KAM more than uniformly assigned modifications and have the potential to slow the progression of medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {Our empirical, neuroscientific understanding of biological motor systems has been rapidly growing in recent years. However, this understanding has not been systematically mapped to a quantitative characterization of motor control based in control theory. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by describing the neural optimal control hierarchy (NOCH), which can serve as a foundation for biologically plausible models of neural motor control. The NOCH has been constructed by taking recent control theoretic models of motor control, analyzing the required processes, generating neurally plausible equivalent calculations and mapping them on to the neural structures that have been empirically identified to form the anatomical basis of motor control. We demonstrate the utility of the NOCH by constructing a simple model based on the identified principles and testing it in two ways. First, we perturb specific anatomical elements of the model and compare the resulting motor behavior with clinical data in which the corresponding area of the brain has been damaged. We show that damaging the assigned functions of the basal ganglia and cerebellum can cause the movement deficiencies seen in patients with Huntington's disease and cerebellar lesions. Second, we demonstrate that single spiking neuron data from our model's motor cortical areas explain major features of single-cell responses recorded from the same primate areas. We suggest that together these results show how NOCH-based models can be used to unify a broad range of data relevant to biological motor control in a quantitative, control theoretic framework.},

abstract = {Children with cerebral palsy frequently walk with excessive internal rotation of the hip. Spastic medial hamstrings or adductors are presumed to contribute to the excessive internal rotation in some patients; however, the capacity of these muscles to produce internal rotation during walking in individuals with cerebral palsy has not been adequately investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the hip rotation moment arms of the medial hamstrings and adductors in persons who walk with a crouched, internally-rotated gait. Highly accurate computer models of three subjects with cerebral palsy were created from magnetic resonance images. These subject-specific models were used in conjunction with joint kinematics obtained from gait analysis to calculate the rotational moment arms of the muscles at body positions corresponding to each subject's internally-rotated gait. Analysis of the models revealed that the medial hamstrings, adductor brevis, and gracilis had negligible or external rotation moment arms throughout the gait cycle in all three subjects. The adductor longus had an internal rotation moment arm in two of the subjects, but the moment arm was small ({\textless} 4 mm) in each case. These findings indicate that neither the medial hamstrings nor the adductor brevis, adductor longus, or gracilis are likely to be important contributors to excessive internal rotation of the hip. This suggests that these muscles should not be lengthened to treat excessive internal rotation of the hip and that other factors are more likely to cause internally-rotated gait in these patients.

abstract = {Valero-Cuevas, Francisco J. Predictive Modulation of Muscle Coordination Pattern Magnitude Scales Fingertip Force Magnitude Over the Voluntary Range. J. Neurophysiol. 83: 1469-1479, 2000. Human fingers have sufficiently more muscles than joints such that every fingertip force of submaximal magnitude can be produced by an infinite number of muscle coordination patterns. Nevertheless, the nervous system seems to effortlessly select muscle coordination patterns when sequentially producing fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude. The hypothesis of this study is that the selection of coordination patterns to produce submaximal forces is simplified by the appropriate modulation of the magnitude of a muscle coordination pattern capable of producing the largest expected fingertip force. In each of three directions, eight subjects were asked to sequentially produce fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude with their dominant forefinger. Muscle activity was described by fine-wire electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously collected from all muscles of the forefinger. A muscle coordination pattern was defined as the vector list of the EMG activity of each muscle. For all force directions, statistically significant muscle coordination patterns similar to those previously reported for 100{\%} of maximal fingertip forces were found for 50{\%} of maximal voluntary force. Furthermore the coordination pattern and fingertip force vector magnitudes were highly correlated (r {\textgreater} 0.88). Average coordination pattern vectors at 50 and 100{\%} of maximal force were highly correlated with each other, as well as with individual coordination pattern vectors in the ramp transitions preceding them. In contrast to this consistency of EMG coordination patterns, predictions using a musculoskeletal computer model of the forefinger show that force magnitudes [{\textless}=]50{\%} of maximal fingertip force can be produced by coordination patterns drastically different from those needed for maximal force. Thus when modulating fingertip force magnitude across the voluntary range, the number of contributing muscles and the relative activity among them was not changed. Rather, the production of low and moderate forces seems to be simplified by appropriately scaling the magnitude of a coordination pattern capable of producing the highest force expected.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Impaired control of mediolateral body motion during walking is an important health concern. Developing treatments to improve mediolateral control is challenging, partly because the mechanisms by which muscles modulate mediolateral ground reaction force (and thereby modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center) during unimpaired walking are poorly understood. To investigate this, we examined mediolateral ground reaction forces in eight unimpaired subjects walking at four speeds and determined the contributions of muscles, gravity, and velocity-related forces to the mediolateral ground reaction force by analyzing muscle-driven simulations of these subjects. During early stance (0-6{\%} gait cycle), peak ground reaction force on the leading foot was directed laterally and increased significantly (p{\textless}0.05) with walking speed. During early single support (14-30{\%} gait cycle), peak ground reaction force on the stance foot was directed medially and increased significantly (p{\textless}0.01) with speed. Muscles accounted for more than 92{\%} of the mediolateral ground reaction force over all walking speeds, whereas gravity and velocity-related forces made relatively small contributions. Muscles coordinate mediolateral acceleration via an interplay between the medial ground reaction force contributed by the abductors and the lateral ground reaction forces contributed by the knee extensors, plantarflexors, and adductors. Our findings show how muscles that contribute to forward progression and body-weight support also modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center while weight is transferred from one leg to another during double support. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Osteoarthritis is a common rheumatologic disease. Several non operative interventions have been described for the treatment. But the available evidences of comparing the effectiveness of Virtual reality training over sensory motor training are very few. So, the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Virtual reality training over sensory motor training in the treatment of Osteoarthritis. 60 subjects who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into three Groups (1, 2 {\&} 3) with randomized sampling method. Group 1 treated with Virtual reality training (VRT), Group 2 treated with sensory motor training (SMT) and Group 3 (control) treated with conventional exercise training (CET). The duration of the treatment was three times per week for 8 weeks in all the three groups. Subjects were assessed at baseline, at 4 th and 8 th week. Pain Intensity by Visual Analog scale (VAS), Joint Proprioception by Perception Sense, Functional Disability by WOMAC Score, and Quality of Life by HRQOL score were measured. A statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) difference between all the 3 groups were noted at the period of 8 week for pain intensity, joint proprioception, functional disability and quality of life. Group-1 treated with (VRT) shows more significant improvement in all parameters compared with Group-2 (SMT) and Group-3 (CET). In conclusion, the addition of virtual reality training to conventional training exercises could improve pain and proprioception which subsequently improve the functional level and quality of life of OA patients.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanics of the aortic valve has been a focus of attention for many years in the biomechanics literature, with the aim of improving the longevity of prosthetic replacements. Finite element models have been extensively used to investigate stresses and deformations in the valve in considerable detail. However, the effect of uncertainties in loading, material properties and model dimensions has remained uninvestigated. This paper presents a formal statistical consideration of a selected set of uncertainties on a fluid-driven finite element model of the aortic valve and examines the magnitudes of the resulting output uncertainties. Furthermore, the importance of each parameter is investigated by means of a global sensitivity analysis. To reduce computational cost, a Bayesian emulator-based approach is adopted whereby a Gaussian process is fitted to a small set of training data and then used to infer detailed sensitivity analysis information. From the set of uncertain parameters considered, it was found that output standard deviations were as high as 44{\%} of the mean. It was also found that the material properties of the sinus and aorta were considerably more important in determining leaflet stress than the material properties of the leaflets themselves. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a subject-specific 3-D model of the lower extremity to predict neuromuscular control effects on 3-D knee joint loading during movements that can potentially cause injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee. The simulation consisted of a forward dynamic 3-D musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity, scaled to represent a specific subject. Inputs of the model were the initial position and velocity of the skeletal elements, and the muscle stimulation patterns. Outputs of the model were movement and ground reaction forces, as well as resultant 3-D forces and moments acting across the knee joint. An optimization method was established to find muscle stimulation patterns that best reproduced the subject's movement and ground reaction forces during a sidestepping task. The optimized model produced movements and forces that were generally within one standard deviation of the measured subject data. Resultant knee joint loading variables extracted from the optimized model were comparable to those reported in the literature. The ability of the model to successfully predict the subject's response to altered initial conditions was quantified and found acceptable for use of the model to investigate the effect of altered neuromuscular control on knee joint loading during sidestepping. Monte Carlo simulations (N = 100,000) using randomly perturbed initial kinematic conditions, based on the subject's variability, resulted in peak anterior force, valgus torque and internal torque values of 378 N, 94 Nm and 71 Nm, respectively, large enough to cause ACL rupture. We conclude that the procedures described in this paper were successful in creating valid simulations of normal movement, and in simulating injuries that are caused by perturbed neuromuscular control.},

abstract = {The goal of this project was to develop a computer simulation of normal human walking that would use as driving moments resultant joint moments from a gait analysis. The system description, initial conditions and driving moments were taken from an inverse dynamics analysis of a normal walking trial. A nine-segment three-dimensional (3-D) model, including a two-part foot, was used. Torsional, linear springs and dampers were used at the hip joints to keep the trunk vertical and at the knee and ankle joints to prevent nonphysiological motion. Dampers at other joints were required to ensure a smooth and realistic motion. The simulated human successfully completed one step (550 ms), including both single and double support phases. The model proved to be sensitive to changes in the spring stiffness values of the trunk controllers. Similar sensitivity was found with the springs used to prevent hyperextension of the knee at heel contact and of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint at push-off. In general, there was much less sensitivity to the damping coefficients. This simulation improves on previous efforts because it incorporates some features necessary in simulations designed to answer clinical science questions. Other control algorithms are required, however, to ensure that the model can be realistically adapted to different subjects.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to introduce and validate a novel computationally-efficient subject-specific tibiofemoral joint model. Subjects performed a quasi-static lunge while micro-dose radiation bi-planar X-rays (EOS Imaging, Paris, France) were captured at roughly 0° 20° 45° 60° and 90° of tibiofemoral flexion. Joint translations and rotations were extracted from this experimental data through 2D-to-3D bone reconstructions, using an iterative closest point optimization technique, and employed during model calibration and validation. Subject-specific moving-axis and hinge models for comparisons were constructed in the AnyBody Modeling System (AMS) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-extracted anatomical surfaces and compared against the experimental data. The tibiofemoral axis of the hinge model was defined between the epicondyles while the moving-axis model was defined based on two tibiofemoral flexion angles (0° and 90°) and the articulation modeled such that the tibiofemoral joint axis moved linearly between these two positions as a function of the tibiofemoral flexion. Outside this range, the joint axis was assumed to remain stationary. Overall, the secondary joint kinematics (ML: medial–lateral, AP: anterior-posterior, SI: superior-inferior, IE: internal-external, AA: adduction-abduction) were better approximated by the moving-axis model with mean differences and standard errors of (ML: −1.98 ± 0.37 mm, AP: 6.50 ± 0.82 mm, SI: 0.05 ± 0.20 mm, IE: 0.59 ± 0.36° AA: 1.90 ± 0.79°) and higher coefficients of determination (R2) for each clinical measure.

In forward mode neural signals are fed to the muscles that perform the corresponding motion. In the inverse mode, a specified motion trajectory is used as input and the neural signals that are the root cause of this particular motion are estimated and investigated. Due to the vast amount of information that results from even simple simulations, the results are presented to the expert using visual analytics metaphors and in particular both embodied and symbolic visualizations.

abstract = {The context of this thesis is the interactive manipulation of complex articulated figures by means of geometric constraints (here called tasks), for the purpose of posture control and design. The goal is to determine a posture satisfying a set of prescribed tasks, usually expressed in the Cartesian space. This approach is known as Inverse Kinematics, and a number of analytic and numerical resolution methods have been developed for the control of robot manipulators. These methods have been applied to the computer animation of articulated figures, and to the control of human models for computer-aided ergonomic evaluations of products or workplaces.When dealing with figures that possess a large number of degrees of freedom, such as animal or human figures, their posture is usually controlled by several simultaneous tasks. There are tasks of different nature and function: they can control extremities such as the hands and the feet (for reaching or supporting purposes), as well as the center of mass, for balance control. They can also be used to avoid collisions with surrounding obstacles. The concurrent resolutionof multiple tasks inevitably leads to conflicts that must be resolved with an appropriate strategy. A typical policy is to find a compromise solution that considers weights assigned to each task to indicate their relative importance. However, no task is precisely satisfied with this approach, and selecting appropriate weights is not always straightforward. In this thesis, we introduce a priority strategy for conflict resolution. With this policy, a task is not affected by other tasks of lower priority, and is satisfied as much as possible without affecting tasks of higher priority. The relative priority between two tasks is thus strictly enforced, which is appropriate for situations that cannot tolerate compromises. For example, keeping balance is more important than reaching an object with a hand, and avoiding inter-penetrationof bodies is more important than any other task. Priorities are well-suited to express such hierarchical relationships.Based on a task-priority algorithm developed in robotics for simple manipulators, we introduce a framework that integrates the two conflict resolution strategies: first, the priorities assigned to the tasks are considered and, second, a weighting strategy solves the conflicts between tasks having same priority. We have improved the efficiency of the original algorithm by means of recursive relations, which is beneficial for interactive applications. Joint limits and joint couplings are also integrated in the framework to avoid unfeasible body postures.An interactive application, called BALANCE, has been developed to test the algorithm with a palette of task types: it allows us to illustrate the utility of task priorities for the manipulation of generic articulated figures, and of human models in particular. Besides simple geometric tasks,the application also proposes a task to keep the figure balanced under a set of static forces due to the interaction with its environment. It is shown that this task is easily integrated in the inverse kinematics framework, and that it is useful to generate postures in multiple supports with force exertions such as push and pull activities.},

abstract = {A neural model is developed of the neural circuitry in the reticular formation that is used to generate saccadic eye movements. The model simulates the behavior of identified cell types—such as long-lead burst neurons, short-lead excitatory and inhibitory burst neurons, omnipause neurons, and tonic neurons—under many experimental conditions. Simulated phenomena include: saccade staircases, duration and amplitude of cell discharges for saccades of variable amplitude, component stretching to achieve straight oblique saccades, saturation of saccade velocity after saturation of saccade amplitude in response to high stimulation frequencies, trade-offs between saccade velocity and duration to generate constant saccade amplitude, conservation of saccade amplitude in response to sufficiently brief stimulation of omnipause neurons, and high velocity smooth eye movements evoked by high levels of electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus. Previous saccade generator models have not explained this range of data. These models have also invoked mechanisms for which no neurophysiological evidence has been forthcoming, such as resetable integrators, perfect integrators, or target position movement commands. The present model utilizes only known reticular formation neurons. It suggests that a key part of the feedback loop within the saccade generator is realized by inhibitory feedback from short-lead to long-lead burst neurons, in response to excitatory feedforward signals from long-lead to short-lead burst neurons. When this property is combined with opponent interactions between agonist and antagonist muscle-controlling neurons, and motor error, or vector, inputs from the superior colliculus and other saccade-controlling brain regions, all of the above data can be explained. Taken together, these components generate a saccade reset cycle whereby activation of long-lead burst neurons inhibits omnipause neurons and thereby disinhibits short-lead excitatory burst neurons. The excitatory short-lead burst neurons can then respond to excitatory inputs from the long-lead burst neurons. Outputs from the excitatory short-lead burst neurons are integrated by the tonic cells while they also inhibit the long-lead burst neurons via inhibitory burst interneurons. When this inhibition is complete, the omnipause neurons are disinhibited. The omnipause neurons can then, once again, inhibit the short-lead burst neurons, whose inhibition of the long-lead burst neurons is thereby removed. The saccadic cycle can then begin again. In response to sustained electrical input, this cycle generates a staircase of identical saccades whose properties match the data much better than the staircases proposed by alternative models. A comparative analysis of the hypotheses and predictive capabilities of other saccade generator models is provided.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In phase I, the positions of the bones and the activation levels of the muscles are found by maximizing the isometric torque developed for each degree of freedom at each joint. In phase II, the architectural properties of each musculotendon actuator are found by matching the strength profile of the model to that measured for subjects. The method is used to estimate the architectural properties of 26 major muscle groups crossing the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Wherever possible, the model calculations are compared against measurements obtained from anatomical studies reported in the literature.

abstract = {We give a simple and self contained introduction to quaternions and their practical usage in dynamics. The rigid body dynamics are presented in full details. In the appendix, some more exotic relations are given that allow to write more complex models, for instance, the one of a satellite with inertial wheels and expressed in a non-inertial reference frame. As it is well known, one nice advantage of quaternions over Euler angles, beside the usual arguments, is that it allows to write down quite complex dynamics completely by hand.},

@article{Sherman2011,
abstract = {Multibody software designed for mechanical engineering has been successfully employed in biomedical research for many years. For real time operation some biomedical researchers have also adapted game physics engines. However, these tools were built for other purposes and do not fully address the needs of biomedical researchers using them to analyze the dynamics of biological structures and make clinically meaningful recommendations. We are addressing this problem through the development of an open source, extensible, high performance toolkit including a multibody mechanics library aimed at the needs of biomedical researchers. The resulting code, Simbody, supports research in a variety of fields including neuromuscular, prosthetic, and biomolecular simulation, and related research such as biologically-inspired design and control of humanoid robots and avatars. Simbody is the dynamics engine behind OpenSim, a widely used biomechanics simulation application. This article reviews issues that arise uniquely in biomedical research, and reports on the architecture, theory, and computational methods Simbody uses to address them. By addressing these needs explicitly Simbody provides a better match to the needs of researchers than can be obtained by adaptation of mechanical engineering or gaming codes. Simbody is a community resource, free for any purpose. We encourage wide adoption and invite contributions to the code base at https://simtk.org/home/simbody. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},
